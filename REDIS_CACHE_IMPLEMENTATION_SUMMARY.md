# Redis Cache Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Redis-backed caching to replace in-memory caches across Tracktion services.

## Overview

Replaced in-memory caching with Redis-backed caching across multiple services to provide:
- Persistent caching across service restarts
- Shared cache between multiple service instances
- Better memory management
- Configurable TTL settings
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### 1. ProductionCacheService (/services/shared/production_cache_service.py)

Created a unified Redis caching service that provides:

**Key Features:**
- Redis connection with automatic retry logic
- Configurable TTL settings (SHORT_TTL: 1h, MEDIUM_TTL: 7d, LONG_TTL: 30d)
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback behavior
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Pattern-based cache invalidation
- Hash operations for complex data structures
- Health checks and connection monitoring
- Statistical tracking (hits, misses, errors)

**Methods:**
- `get(key)` / `set(key, value, ttl)` - Basic operations
- `delete(key)` / `exists(key)` - Key management
- `increment(key, amount, ttl)` - Atomic increments
- `hash_set/hash_get/hash_get_all` - Hash operations
- `clear_pattern(pattern)` - Pattern-based cleanup
- `flush_service_cache()` - Service-wide cache clear
- `get_stats()` / `health_check()` - Monitoring

### 2. File Rename Service Predictor Updates

**Before:** In-memory dictionary cache with LRU eviction
**After:** Redis-backed cache with intelligent TTL

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced `prediction_cache: dict` with `ProductionCacheService`
- Added confidence-based TTL (4h for low confidence, 24h for high confidence)
- Enhanced cache keys to include prediction parameters
- Added model version-based cache invalidation
- Fallback behavior when Redis is unavailable

**Cache Key Format:** `{model_version}:{filename}:{return_probabilities}:{top_k}`

### 3. ML Routers Training Jobs Cache

**Before:** Global in-memory dictionary `training_jobs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]] = {}`
**After:** Redis-backed cache with helper functions

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced global dict with `ProductionCacheService` instance
- Added helper functions: `get_training_job()`, `set_training_job()`, `update_training_job()`
- TTL: 7 days for training job status
- Graceful fallback to in-memory dict when Redis unavailable
- Automatic cleanup of completed jobs

### 4. Tracklist Service Cache Enhancement

**Before:** Basic Redis operations with limited memory fallback
**After:** Multi-tier caching with intelligent fallback

**Key Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `MemoryCache` class with proper LRU eviction and expiration
- Added `_get_with_fallback()` and `_set_with_fallback()` methods
- Memory cache used as L1 cache (5 min TTL), Redis as L2 cache
- Improved error handling and connection recovery
- Added `cleanup_memory_cache()` method

**Cache Hierarchy:** Memory Cache (L1) → Redis Cache (L2) → Source

### 5. Analysis Service Audio Cache Enhancement

**Before:** Basic Redis operations with minimal error handling
**After:** Robust Redis operations with connection management

**Key Enhancements:**
- Added connection retry logic with configurable attempts and delay
- Implemented `_ensure_connection()` for automatic reconnection
- Added `_safe_redis_operation()` wrapper for all Redis operations
- Enhanced error handling for connection failures
- Connection health monitoring with ping checks

### 6. Cache Invalidation Framework

Created comprehensive invalidation system (/services/shared/cache_invalidation.py):

**Features:**
- Multiple invalidation strategies (IMMEDIATE, TIME_BASED, EVENT_BASED, LAZY, PATTERN_BASED)
- TTL configurations by data type (audio_analysis, ml_predictions, cue_generation, search_results)
- Adaptive TTL based on confidence levels and data age
- Bulk invalidation processing
- Service-specific invalidation methods

**Invalidation Methods:**
- `invalidate_audio_analysis()` - Clear audio analysis results
- `invalidate_ml_predictions()` - Clear ML prediction cache
- `invalidate_tracklist_cache()` - Clear tracklist-related cache
- `invalidate_search_cache()` - Clear search results
- `bulk_invalidate()` - Process multiple invalidation requests

## TTL Configuration Strategy

### Audio Analysis Results
- BPM/Temporal/Key: 30 days (expensive to compute)
- Mood analysis: 7 days (may change more frequently)

### ML Predictions
- High confidence (>0.9): 24 hours
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.9): 12 hours
- Low confidence (<0.5): 4 hours
- Training jobs: 7 days

### CUE Generation
- Content: 2 hours
- Validation: 30 minutes
- Format capabilities: 24 hours

### Search Results
- Successful: 1 hour
- Failed: 10 minutes

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Connection Management
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Connection health monitoring with ping checks
- Graceful degradation when Redis unavailable
- Fallback to in-memory caching where applicable

### Error Recovery
- Safe operation wrappers catch and log Redis errors
- Connection recovery attempts on operation failure
- Statistical tracking of errors for monitoring
- Service continues operation without cache when Redis fails

## Performance Benefits

### Memory Usage
- Reduced service memory footprint by externalizing cache
- Shared cache between multiple service instances
- Automatic memory management by Redis

### Scalability
- Support for distributed caching across multiple instances
- Horizontal scaling of services without cache warming
- Persistent cache across service restarts and deployments

### Operational
- Centralized cache monitoring and management
- Pattern-based cache invalidation for bulk operations
- Health checks and statistics for operational visibility

## Configuration

Each service can configure Redis caching independently:

```python
cache = ProductionCacheService(
    redis_host="localhost",
    redis_port=6379,
    redis_db=1,  # Different DB per service
    service_prefix="service_name",
    default_ttl=3600,
    enabled=True
)
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Statistics Available
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Error counts and types
- Memory usage (Redis + local)
- Connection health status
- Invalidation patterns and frequency

### Health Checks
- Redis connection status
- Response time monitoring
- Cache service availability
- Memory usage thresholds

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Distributed Locking** - For coordinated cache updates across instances
2. **Cache Warming** - Proactive cache population strategies
3. **Compression** - Automatic compression for large cache values
4. **Metrics Export** - Integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus)
5. **Configuration Management** - Dynamic TTL adjustment based on usage patterns

### Considerations
1. **Redis Clustering** - For high availability in production
2. **Backup/Recovery** - Cache backup strategies for critical data
3. **Security** - Redis AUTH and TLS for production environments
4. **Resource Management** - Memory limits and eviction policies

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
All services maintain backward compatibility with graceful fallbacks:
- File Rename Service: Falls back to no caching if Redis unavailable
- ML Routers: Falls back to in-memory dict for training jobs
- Tracklist Service: Falls back to memory-only cache
- Analysis Service: Falls back to no caching with warnings

### Deployment Considerations
1. Redis server must be available before service startup
2. Services will start without caching if Redis is unavailable
3. Cache warming may be needed after deployment
4. Monitor error rates during initial deployment

This implementation provides a solid foundation for scalable, reliable caching across the Tracktion monorepo while maintaining operational flexibility and resilience.
