- **Pre-commit Hooks**: All passing (ruff, mypy, formatting)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with README, API docs, and inline comments
- **Performance**: All operations meet or exceed targets

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Epic 3 Not Started**: Tracklist management features pending
2. **Real Track Validation**: Key detection accuracy not validated with known tracks
3. **Model Storage**: TensorFlow models require ~2-3GB storage

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Epic 3 stories need to be defined and prioritized
2. Acquire test dataset with known musical keys for validation
3. Implement model CDN or lazy loading for production deployment

## Next Sprint Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Define and create Epic 3 stories for Tracklist Management
2. Implement file renaming service (Epic 2 continuation)
3. Create integration tests for complete workflow
4. Deploy to staging environment for user acceptance testing

### Medium Priority
1. Performance optimization for batch processing
2. Create admin UI for monitoring and configuration
3. Implement backup and recovery procedures
4. Add metrics and telemetry for production monitoring

### Low Priority
1. Additional audio format support (OGG, AAC, OPUS)
2. Real-time analysis streaming capabilities
3. Machine learning model improvements
4. API rate limiting and authentication

## Quality Assurance Summary

All completed stories have passed QA review with the following highlights:
- **Story 2.4** received Grade A+ for exceptional implementation
- All stories meet or exceed acceptance criteria
- Test coverage consistently above 80% target
- Code follows established patterns and best practices
- Performance benchmarks documented and validated
