# Goals and Background Context
### **Goals**
* Create a working backend MVP that can catalog and analyze a digital music collection.
* Build a scalable and extensible foundation for future features and a potential frontend.
* Validate the technical approach using Python 3.12+, Docker, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
* Automate the processing of new recordings within a target timeframe of one minute per file.
* Successfully retrieve and apply tracklists from `1001tracklists.com` for at least 80% of recordings that lack them.
* Eliminate the need for manual file renaming and metadata tagging.

### **Background Context**
The project aims to solve the problem of managing a large, disorganized collection of live music recordings. Mainstream music management tools are ill-suited for this content due to a lack of features for handling long single tracks, advanced metadata (BPM, mood, key), and tracklists. The collection is growing, making manual organization unfeasible and creating a need for a dedicated, automated, and extensible solution.
