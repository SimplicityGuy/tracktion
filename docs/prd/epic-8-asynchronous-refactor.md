# Epic 7: Asynchronous Refactor

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID:** EPIC-7
**Epic Name:** Asynchronous Refactor
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** All previous epics (1-6)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks

## Business Value
Converting the entire service to asynchronous operations will:
- Dramatically improve system throughput and responsiveness
- Enable handling of thousands of concurrent file operations
- Reduce resource consumption and infrastructure costs
- Improve user experience with non-blocking operations
- Scale better under heavy load conditions
- Enable real-time streaming of results

## Technical Scope

### Core Requirements
1. **Service Architecture Refactoring**
   - Convert all I/O operations to async/await patterns
   - Implement async message queue consumers
   - Refactor database operations to async drivers
   - Convert file system operations to async methods
   - Update all API endpoints to async handlers

2. **Async Libraries Migration**
   - Database: asyncpg (PostgreSQL), motor (MongoDB), aioredis (Redis)
   - HTTP: aiohttp, httpx for client requests
   - File I/O: aiofiles for file operations
   - Message Queue: aio-pika for RabbitMQ
   - Neo4j: neo4j-python-driver async support

3. **Concurrency Management**
   - Implement proper semaphores for resource limiting
   - Use asyncio locks for critical sections
   - Design task pools for CPU-bound operations
   - Implement circuit breakers for external services
   - Add backpressure handling

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Connection pooling for all external services
   - Batch processing where applicable
   - Streaming responses for large datasets
   - Lazy loading and pagination
   - Caching strategies for async operations

### Technical Considerations

#### Async Patterns to Implement
- **Event Loop Management**: Proper loop lifecycle handling
- **Task Scheduling**: Efficient task queuing and execution
- **Error Propagation**: Consistent async error handling
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper async context managers
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean task cancellation

#### Migration Strategy
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Service by service migration
- **Compatibility Layer**: Support both sync/async during transition
- **Testing Strategy**: Parallel testing of sync/async versions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Before/after metrics collection
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flags for quick reversion

### User Stories

#### Story 7.1: Async File Watching
**As a** system processing many files
**I want** file watching to handle thousands of files concurrently
**So that** large library imports don't block the system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- File watcher uses async I/O operations
- Concurrent processing of multiple file events
- Non-blocking metadata extraction
- Queue operations are asynchronous
- System remains responsive during bulk operations

#### Story 7.2: Async Database Operations
**As a** system with high database load
**I want** all database operations to be non-blocking
**So that** queries don't block other operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All database queries use async drivers
- Connection pooling implemented
- Concurrent query execution
- Transaction support maintained
- Performance improvement measurable

#### Story 7.3: Async Audio Analysis
**As a** service analyzing audio files
**I want** parallel audio processing
**So that** multiple files can be analyzed simultaneously

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Audio decoding in thread pool
- Async result handling
- Progress streaming to clients
- Resource limits enforced
- CPU cores efficiently utilized

#### Story 7.4: Async API Endpoints
**As an** API consumer
**I want** all endpoints to be non-blocking
**So that** the API can handle many concurrent requests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All FastAPI endpoints are async
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Streaming responses where appropriate
- Request timeout handling
- Proper error propagation

#### Story 7.5: Async External Service Calls
**As a** system calling external APIs
**I want** non-blocking HTTP requests
**So that** external service delays don't block operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All HTTP calls use async clients
- Concurrent request handling
- Retry logic is async-aware
- Circuit breakers implemented
- Connection pooling configured

## Code Examples

### Before (Synchronous)
```python
def process_file(file_path):
    metadata = extract_metadata(file_path)
    analysis = analyze_audio(file_path)
    db.save(metadata)
    queue.publish(analysis)
    return {"status": "completed"}
```

### After (Asynchronous)
```python
async def process_file(file_path):
    metadata_task = asyncio.create_task(extract_metadata_async(file_path))
    analysis_task = asyncio.create_task(analyze_audio_async(file_path))

    metadata = await metadata_task
    analysis = await analysis_task

    await asyncio.gather(
        db.save_async(metadata),
        queue.publish_async(analysis)
    )
    return {"status": "completed"}
```

## Performance Targets
- Request handling: >1000 concurrent requests
- File processing: >100 concurrent file operations
