# User Interface Design Goals
Based on the Project Brief, which specified a backend-first approach, there are no immediate UI/UX requirements for the MVP. However, we'll establish some high-level goals and assumptions here to guide future work and provide context for the architecture.

### **Overall UX Vision**
The long-term vision is a user-friendly web interface that makes managing a large music library effortless. It should feel intuitive, clean, and provide a clear path for users to discover and organize their music.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**
The future application should prioritize clarity and simplicity, with user interactions that are both efficient for power users and approachable for casual users.

### **Core Screens and Views**
Since a full frontend is out of scope for the MVP, the core "screens" at this stage will be command-line outputs and system logs.

### **Accessibility**
**Accessibility: None**
Accessibility will be addressed in a later phase when a user interface is being developed.

### **Branding**
At this time, there are no specific branding elements or style guides to incorporate.

### **Target Device and Platforms**
**Target Device and Platforms: None**
The MVP is a backend-only system and therefore has no target device or platform requirements.
