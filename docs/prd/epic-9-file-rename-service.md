# Epic 9: AI-Driven File Rename Service

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID:** EPIC-9
**Epic Name:** AI-Driven File Rename Service
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** Epic 1-8 (core system operational)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks

## Business Value
An intelligent, learning-based file rename service will:
- Automatically identify patterns in existing filenames
- Learn from user preferences and approvals
- Provide increasingly accurate rename suggestions over time
- Offer flexible, user-defined naming structures
- Significantly reduce manual file organization effort
- Improve consistency across the music library

## Technical Scope

### Core Requirements
1. **Standalone Service Architecture**
   - Separate microservice (NOT part of analysis_service)
   - Own Docker container and deployment
   - Dedicated message queue topics
   - Independent database tables for ML models and patterns

2. **Pattern Recognition & Tokenization**
   - Analyze existing filenames for tokenizable patterns
   - Identify common components (artist, venue, date, quality, etc.)
   - Build dynamic token vocabulary from file corpus
   - Handle various naming conventions and formats

3. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Implement ML model for pattern recognition
   - Train on user-approved renames
   - Continuous learning from feedback
   - Model versioning and rollback capability

4. **User Interaction (Future UI Integration)**
   - Present detected tokens/parts to users
   - Allow custom naming structure creation
   - Approval/rejection feedback loop
   - Batch rename proposals

### Technical Considerations

#### Architecture Changes
- New service: `file_rename_service`
- Remove rename functionality from `analysis_service`
- New ML model storage (PostgreSQL + file storage)
- New API endpoints for rename operations

#### Technology Stack
- Python 3.12+ for service implementation
- scikit-learn or TensorFlow for ML
- FastAPI for service API
- PostgreSQL for pattern/model storage
- Redis for caching predictions

#### Pattern Recognition Approach
- Regex-based initial tokenization
- Statistical analysis of token frequency
- Clustering similar patterns
- Confidence scoring for proposals

### User Stories

#### Story 9.1: Create Standalone File Rename Service
**As a** system architect
**I want** a dedicated service for file renaming
**So that** the functionality is properly isolated and scalable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New service created with proper structure
- Docker container configuration
- RabbitMQ integration
- API endpoints defined
- Service registry updated

#### Story 9.2: Implement Pattern Tokenization
**As a** system analyzing filenames
**I want** to identify tokenizable patterns
**So that** I can understand filename components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Token extraction from various filename formats
- Dynamic token vocabulary building
- Pattern frequency analysis
- Token categorization (artist, date, venue, etc.)
- Handle edge cases and unusual formats

#### Story 9.3: Build ML Model for Pattern Learning
**As a** system learning from user behavior
**I want** an ML model that improves suggestions
**So that** rename proposals get more accurate over time

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ML model architecture defined
- Training pipeline implemented
- Feedback incorporation mechanism
- Model evaluation metrics
- Versioning and rollback capability

#### Story 9.4: Create Rename Proposal Engine
**As a** user organizing files
**I want** intelligent rename suggestions
**So that** I can quickly organize my library

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generate rename proposals based on patterns
- Confidence scoring for each proposal
- Batch proposal generation
- Proposal explanation (why this rename)
- Handle conflicts and duplicates

#### Story 9.5: Implement Feedback Learning Loop
**As a** system improving over time
**I want** to learn from approved/rejected renames
**So that** future suggestions are more accurate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Capture user approval/rejection
- Update ML model with feedback
- Track improvement metrics
- A/B testing capability
- Continuous learning pipeline

## ML Model Specifications

### Initial Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest or LSTM for sequence learning
- Features: Token sequences, position, frequency
- Training data: Existing filenames + user feedback
- Evaluation: Precision, recall, F1 score

### Learning Strategy
- Online learning for continuous improvement
- Batch retraining weekly
- A/B testing for model updates
- Fallback to rule-based system if needed

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for tokenization logic
- ML model validation tests
- Integration tests with other services
- Performance tests with large datasets
- User acceptance testing scenarios

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Poor pattern recognition | High | Start with rule-based, enhance with ML |
| Model overfitting | Medium | Regularization, cross-validation |
| Scalability issues | Medium | Implement caching, optimize algorithms |
| User rejection of suggestions | High | Provide manual override, gather feedback |
