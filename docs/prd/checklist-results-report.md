# Checklist Results Report
I have successfully drafted the story for Project Setup & Dockerization. I will now validate this draft using the `story-draft-checklist` to ensure it contains all the necessary information for a developer agent to begin implementation.

* **1. Goal & Context Clarity:** ✅ PASS
    * The story clearly states the goal of setting up the project and the context within the larger project. The acceptance criteria are measurable.
* **2. Technical Implementation Guidance:** ✅ PASS
    * The `Dev Notes` section provides specific guidance on the repository structure, testing frameworks, and datastore setup, all with clear references to the architecture document.
* **3. Reference Effectiveness:** ✅ PASS
    * All technical details are summarized in the `Dev Notes` section and include citations to the relevant architectural documents, so the developer agent will not need to hunt for context.
* **4. Self-Containment Assessment:** ✅ PASS
    * The story is self-contained and provides enough information to be implemented without needing to read other documents in full.
* **5. Testing Guidance:** ✅ PASS
    * The story explicitly mentions that the developer needs to verify the successful execution of the containerized service, which is a clear testing requirement.

**Final Assessment:** **✅ READY** - The story provides sufficient context for implementation.
