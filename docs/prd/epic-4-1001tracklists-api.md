# Epic 4: Build 1001tracklists.com API

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID:** EPIC-4
**Epic Name:** Build 1001tracklists.com API
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Foundation & Core Services)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks

## Business Value
1001tracklists.com is the industry-standard resource for DJ tracklists and setlists. Creating an API for this service will:
- Enable automatic tracklist retrieval for DJ sets and mixes
- Provide accurate track identification and timestamps
- Support CUE file generation with verified track information
- Enhance cataloging with professional DJ set data
- Enable cross-referencing of tracks across multiple DJ sets

## Technical Scope

### Core Requirements
1. **Web Scraping Infrastructure**
   - Robust HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup/Scrapy
   - Session management and cookie handling
   - Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
   - User-agent rotation and proxy support

2. **API Design**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Search functionality (by DJ, event, date, track)
   - Tracklist retrieval with full metadata
   - Pagination support for large result sets
   - Response caching strategy

3. **Data Extraction**
   - DJ/Artist information
   - Event details (venue, date, type)
   - Complete tracklist with timestamps
   - Track metadata (artist, title, label, remix)
   - Mix/transition information
   - User interactions (favorites, comments counts)

4. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Fallback strategies for site changes
   - Comprehensive error reporting
   - Health monitoring and alerting

### Technical Considerations

#### Architecture Components
- **Scraper Service**: Dedicated microservice for web scraping
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for response caching
- **Queue System**: RabbitMQ for async scraping jobs
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI or Flask for REST endpoints
- **Data Store**: PostgreSQL for scraped data persistence

#### Anti-Detection Measures
- Randomized request delays
- Browser-like request headers
- Cookie persistence
- JavaScript rendering capability (Selenium/Playwright if needed)
- Distributed scraping with multiple IPs

#### Legal & Ethical Considerations
- Respect robots.txt
- Implement reasonable rate limits
- Cache aggressively to minimize requests
- Clear attribution in generated CUE files
- Terms of Service compliance review

### User Stories

#### Story 4.1: Search for DJ Sets
**As a** DJ cataloging my music
**I want** to search for specific DJ sets on 1001tracklists
**So that** I can retrieve accurate tracklist information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Search by DJ name returns relevant results
- Search by event/festival name works
- Date range filtering available
- Results include basic set information
- Pagination for large result sets

#### Story 4.2: Retrieve Complete Tracklist
**As a** user creating CUE files
**I want** to retrieve complete tracklist data for a specific set
**So that** I can generate accurate CUE files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Full tracklist with all available tracks
- Accurate timestamps for each track
- Track metadata (artist, title, remix, label)
- Handling of unknown/ID tracks
- Mix transition information preserved

#### Story 4.3: Handle Site Updates Gracefully
**As a** system administrator
**I want** the scraper to handle site changes gracefully
**So that** the service remains reliable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Monitoring detects structural changes
- Graceful degradation when elements missing
- Alerts generated for breaking changes
- Fallback to cached data when available
- Quick adaptation to minor changes

#### Story 4.4: Batch Processing Support
**As a** user with many mixes to catalog
**I want** to process multiple tracklists efficiently
**So that** I can build my catalog quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Queue multiple scraping requests
- Parallel processing with rate limiting
- Progress tracking for batch jobs
- Error recovery for failed items
- Result aggregation and reporting

#### Story 4.5: API Rate Limiting & Authentication
**As a** service operator
**I want** proper API rate limiting and authentication
**So that** the service is not abused

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API key authentication implemented
- Per-user rate limiting
- Usage tracking and quotas
- Rate limit headers in responses
- Graceful handling of limit exceeded

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Scraping Foundation (Week 1)
1. Set up scraping infrastructure
2. Implement basic page parsing
3. Create data models for tracklists
4. Build initial extraction logic

### Phase 2: API Development (Week 2)
1. Design RESTful API structure
2. Implement search endpoints
3. Add tracklist retrieval endpoints
4. Set up caching layer

### Phase 3: Resilience & Optimization (Week 3)
1. Add retry and error handling
2. Implement anti-detection measures
3. Optimize scraping performance
4. Add monitoring and alerting

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 4)
1. Integrate with main application
2. Comprehensive testing suite
3. Load testing and optimization
4. Documentation and examples

## Success Metrics
- API uptime >99.5%
- Successful scraping rate >95%
- Response time <2s for cached requests
- Cache hit rate >80%
- Zero detection/blocking incidents
- Complete tracklist accuracy >98%

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Site structure changes | High | Monitoring, alerts, quick adaptation process |
| IP blocking/rate limiting | High | Proxy rotation, respectful crawling, caching |
| Legal concerns | High | Review ToS, implement ethical scraping, clear attribution |
| Performance issues | Medium | Caching, async processing, optimization |
| Data quality issues | Medium | Validation, user feedback, manual correction options |
