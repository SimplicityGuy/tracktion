# Epic 10: Missing Components

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID:** EPIC-10
**Epic Name:** Missing Components
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** Epic 1-9
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks

## Business Value
Completing missing components ensures:
- Full system functionality as originally designed
- Multiple notification channels for better user reach
- Complete service implementation per architecture
- No gaps in the data processing pipeline
- Professional multi-channel alert capabilities

## Technical Scope

### Core Requirements
1. **Cataloging Service Implementation**
   - Complete missing cataloging_service
   - Implement all designed functionality
   - Database operations for recording catalog
   - Message queue integration
   - API endpoints for catalog management

2. **Enhanced Notification System**
   - Add email notification support
   - Add Slack integration
   - Maintain existing Discord support
   - Configurable notification preferences
   - Template system for notifications

### Technical Considerations

#### Cataloging Service
- Service was designed but never implemented
- Critical for recording management
- Interfaces with PostgreSQL for storage
- Handles file metadata persistence

#### Notification Enhancements
- Currently Discord-only in tracklist_service
- Need pluggable notification architecture
- Support for multiple simultaneous channels
- User preference management

### User Stories

#### Story 10.1: Implement Cataloging Service
**As a** system managing music files
**I want** a dedicated cataloging service
**So that** all recordings are properly tracked and managed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Service structure created following project standards
- Database operations implemented (CRUD for recordings)
- RabbitMQ consumer for catalog events
- API endpoints for catalog queries
- Proper error handling and logging
- Docker container configured
- Unit tests with 80% coverage

#### Story 10.2: Add Email Notifications
**As a** user of the system
**I want** to receive email notifications
**So that** I'm alerted through my preferred channel

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Email service integration (SMTP)
- HTML and text email templates
- Configurable email settings
- Email queuing for reliability
- Delivery status tracking
- Unsubscribe mechanism
- Test mode for development

#### Story 10.3: Add Slack Integration
**As a** team using Slack
**I want** notifications in Slack channels
**So that** the team stays informed of system events

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Slack webhook support
- Slack app integration option
- Channel configuration
- Message formatting for Slack
- Rate limiting compliance
- Error handling for failed sends
- Documentation for setup

#### Story 10.4: Refactor Notification Architecture
**As a** system sending notifications
**I want** a unified notification system
**So that** adding new channels is easy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Abstract notification interface
- Plugin architecture for channels
- Notification preference management
- Retry logic for failed notifications
- Notification history logging
- Template system for consistent messaging
- Configuration via environment variables

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Cataloging Service (Week 1)
1. Create service structure
2. Implement database models and operations
3. Set up RabbitMQ consumers
4. Create API endpoints
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Docker configuration

### Phase 2: Notification System (Week 2)
1. Design notification architecture
2. Refactor existing Discord integration
3. Implement email support
4. Add Slack integration
5. Create preference management
6. Testing and documentation

### Notification System Architecture
```python
# Abstract interface
class NotificationChannel(ABC):
    async def send(self, message: Message) -> Result

# Implementations
class EmailChannel(NotificationChannel)
class SlackChannel(NotificationChannel)
class DiscordChannel(NotificationChannel)
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Email Configuration
- SMTP_HOST
- SMTP_PORT
- SMTP_USERNAME
- SMTP_PASSWORD
- FROM_EMAIL
- EMAIL_TEMPLATES_PATH

### Slack Configuration
- SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
- SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (optional)
- SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL

### Notification Preferences
- User-level channel preferences
- Event-type routing rules
- Priority-based channel selection

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new code
- Integration tests for service communication
- Email testing with mock SMTP
- Slack testing with mock endpoints
- End-to-end notification flow tests
- Load testing for cataloging service

## Success Metrics
- Cataloging service processing 1000+ files/minute
- Email delivery rate >95%
- Slack message delivery <2s
- All notification channels working simultaneously
- Zero message loss under normal operation
- 80% test coverage for new code

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Email delivery issues | Medium | Use reliable email service, implement retry |
| Slack rate limiting | Low | Implement rate limiting, message batching |
| Cataloging service performance | High | Optimize database queries, add caching |
| Notification spam | Medium | Implement throttling, user preferences |

## Dependencies
- Email service provider (SMTP)
- Slack API access
- PostgreSQL for cataloging data
- RabbitMQ for message passing
- Existing Discord implementation
