# Epic 3: Missing File Format (Ogg Vorbis Support)

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID:** EPIC-3
**Epic Name:** Missing File Format - Ogg Vorbis Support
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Foundation & Core Services), Epic 2 (Metadata Analysis & Naming)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

## Business Value
The Ogg Vorbis format is a popular open-source audio format used by many DJs and music professionals. Adding support for this format will:
- Expand the system's compatibility with a wider range of audio files
- Enable processing of music libraries that include Ogg Vorbis files
- Ensure comprehensive cataloging across all common audio formats
- Prevent gaps in metadata analysis and file organization workflows

## Technical Scope

### Core Requirements
1. **File Detection & Validation**
   - Detect Ogg Vorbis files by extension (.ogg, .oga) and MIME type
   - Validate file structure and ensure proper Ogg container format
   - Handle corrupted or incomplete files gracefully

2. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Extract Vorbis comments (artist, title, album, date, genre, etc.)
   - Read technical metadata (bitrate, sample rate, channels, duration)
   - Support for embedded album artwork extraction
   - Handle custom/extended metadata fields

3. **Audio Analysis Integration**
   - Decode Ogg Vorbis for BPM detection
   - Support key detection algorithms
   - Enable mood and energy analysis
   - Ensure compatibility with existing audio processing pipeline

4. **File Operations**
   - Support renaming operations for Ogg Vorbis files
   - Preserve metadata during file operations
   - Enable metadata writing/updating capabilities
   - Handle file moves and copies appropriately

### Technical Considerations

#### Libraries & Dependencies
- **Python**: `mutagen` for metadata handling, `pyogg` for decoding
- **Audio Processing**: Ensure `librosa` or current audio library supports Ogg
- **Performance**: Consider caching decoded audio for analysis operations

#### Integration Points
- File Watcher Service: Add Ogg extensions to monitored file types
- Metadata Service: Extend to handle Vorbis comment format
- Analysis Service: Ensure audio decoders support Ogg input
- Cataloging Service: Update schema if needed for format-specific metadata

### User Stories

#### Story 3.1: Ogg Vorbis File Detection
**As a** DJ with Ogg Vorbis files in my library
**I want** the system to automatically detect and catalog my .ogg files
**So that** my entire music collection is properly indexed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System detects files with .ogg, .oga extensions
- File watcher triggers on Ogg Vorbis files
- Files are added to processing queue
- Invalid/corrupted files are logged appropriately

#### Story 3.2: Ogg Vorbis Metadata Extraction
**As a** user organizing my music library
**I want** the system to extract all metadata from Ogg Vorbis files
**So that** I can search and organize based on this information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All standard Vorbis comments are extracted
- Technical metadata is accurately captured
- Custom tags are preserved and accessible
- Missing metadata is handled gracefully

#### Story 3.3: Ogg Vorbis Audio Analysis
**As a** DJ preparing sets
**I want** BPM and key detection to work on Ogg Vorbis files
**So that** I can mix tracks regardless of format

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- BPM detection accuracy matches other formats
- Key detection provides reliable results
- Analysis performance is within acceptable limits
- Results are stored consistently in the catalog

#### Story 3.4: Ogg Vorbis File Renaming
**As a** user with inconsistently named Ogg files
**I want** the automatic renaming to work on Ogg Vorbis files
**So that** my entire library follows consistent naming patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Renaming patterns apply to Ogg files
- Metadata is preserved during rename
- File associations in catalog are maintained
- Undo/rollback capability exists

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Add Ogg Vorbis detection to file watcher
2. Implement basic metadata extraction
3. Create unit tests for Ogg handling
4. Update documentation

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)
1. Integrate with audio analysis pipeline
2. Extend metadata service for Vorbis comments
3. Add Ogg support to renaming service
4. Integration testing

### Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (Week 3)
1. Performance optimization for large Ogg files
2. Enhanced error handling and recovery
3. Complete test coverage
4. User documentation and examples

## Success Metrics
- Successfully process 100% of valid Ogg Vorbis files
- Metadata extraction accuracy >99%
- BPM detection accuracy within 2% of other formats
- Processing time comparable to MP3/FLAC handling
- Zero data loss during file operations

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Library compatibility issues | High | Research and test libraries early, have fallback options |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Implement caching, optimize decoding pipeline |
| Metadata format variations | Medium | Build flexible parser, extensive test data |
| Large file handling | Low | Implement streaming processing where possible |
