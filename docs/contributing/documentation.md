## Writing Guidelines

### Style and Tone

**Writing Style:**
- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **User-Focused**: Write from the user's perspective
- **Action-Oriented**: Tell users what to do, not just what something is
- **Consistent**: Use the same terms and formatting throughout

**Tone:**
- Professional but approachable
- Helpful and encouraging
- Respectful of different skill levels
- Avoid jargon without explanation

### Content Structure

**Document Organization:**
```markdown
# Page Title (H1)

Brief overview paragraph explaining what this page covers.

## What You'll Learn (if tutorial)

- Learning objective 1
- Learning objective 2

## Prerequisites (if applicable)

- Required knowledge
- Required software
- Links to setup guides

## Main Content

### Section 1 (H2)

### Formatting Standards

**Markdown Best Practices:**

```markdown
# Use descriptive headings
## Configure Database Connection

# Include working code examples
```bash
# Start the development server
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

# Use tables for structured information
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `api_key` | Yes | Your API authentication key |

# Use admonitions for important info
!!! warning "Important"
    Always backup your database before running migrations.

# Include realistic examples
```python
from tracktion.analysis import BPMDetector

detector = BPMDetector(confidence_threshold=0.8)
result = detector.analyze("/path/to/song.mp3")
```
```
