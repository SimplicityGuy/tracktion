### 3. Review Guidelines

#### For Reviewers

##### Code Quality Review
```python
# Check for code quality issues
class ReviewChecklist:
    code_quality = [
        "Are functions single-purpose and focused?",
        "Is error handling comprehensive?",
        "Are variable names descriptive?",
        "Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?",
        "Are magic numbers/strings avoided?",
        "Is logging appropriate and informative?"
    ]

    architecture = [
        "Does this fit the existing architecture?",
        "Are design patterns used appropriately?",
        "Is coupling minimized?",
        "Is cohesion maximized?",
        "Are interfaces well-defined?"
    ]

    performance = [
        "Are there any obvious performance issues?",
        "Is database access optimized?",
        "Are large operations paginated?",
        "Is caching used appropriately?",
        "Are resources properly released?"
    ]
```

##### Security Review
```python
security_checklist = [
    "Is input validation comprehensive?",
    "Are SQL injection risks mitigated?",
    "Is authentication properly implemented?",
    "Are authorization checks in place?",
    "Is sensitive data properly handled?",
    "Are HTTPS and secure headers used?",
    "Are dependencies secure and up-to-date?"
]
```

##### Test Quality Review
```python
test_review = [
    "Do tests cover happy path scenarios?",
    "Are edge cases and error conditions tested?",
    "Are tests independent and repeatable?",
    "Is test data realistic and comprehensive?",
    "Are integration points properly tested?",
    "Is test coverage maintained or improved?"
]
```

#### Review Comments Format

##### Constructive Feedback
```markdown
# ‚úÖ Good Examples

## Suggestion
Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for better testability:

```python
# Current
def process_audio(file_path):
    # ... 50 lines of audio processing ...

# Suggested
def process_audio(file_path):
    audio_data = load_audio_file(file_path)
    features = extract_audio_features(audio_data)
    return analyze_features(features)
```

## Question
How does this handle the case where the audio file is corrupted?
Should we add specific error handling for that scenario?

## Nitpick
Minor: Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `data` here.

## Security Concern
This endpoint appears to accept user input without validation.
Should we add input sanitization here?

## Performance
This database query might be expensive with large datasets.
Consider adding pagination or indexing.
```

```markdown
# ‚ùå Poor Examples (Avoid These)

"This is wrong."
"Bad code."
"Fix this."
"This doesn't make sense."
"Use a different approach." (without explanation)
```

### 4. Review Response Process

#### For Authors

##### Addressing Feedback
```bash
# Create a new commit for review changes
git add .
uv run pre-commit run --all-files  # MANDATORY
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback

- Add input validation to audio processing endpoint
- Extract complex logic into separate testable functions
- Improve error handling for corrupted audio files
- Update documentation for new API parameters"

git push origin feature/your-branch
```

##### Response Examples
```markdown
## Addressing Review Comments

### Implemented Changes
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for all audio endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Implemented specific handling for corrupted audio files
- ‚úÖ **Function Extraction**: Extracted audio processing logic into separate functions
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Added database indexing for frequently queried fields

### Explanations
- **Design Decision**: Chose to use Redis caching here because of frequent access patterns
- **Technical Constraint**: Cannot implement suggested approach due to Essentia library limitations

### Questions for Reviewer
- Should we add rate limiting to the new endpoint?
- Is the current error message user-friendly enough?

### Remaining Items
- [ ] Performance testing with large audio files (waiting for test environment)
- [ ] Documentation update (will complete after final API approval)
```
