# Story 2.3: Advanced Audio Analysis - BPM Detection

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 2 - Metadata Analysis & Naming
- **Story Number**: 2.3
- **Status**: Development Complete
- **Created**: 2025-08-18
- **Updated**: 2025-08-19
- **Completed**: 2025-08-19

## Story Statement
**As a** DJ or music enthusiast,
**I want** automatic BPM (beats per minute) detection for my audio files with temporal analysis,
**so that** I can organize my music by tempo and identify tracks with tempo changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. BPM detection algorithm is integrated using the library selected in Story 2.2 research (likely Essentia or librosa).
2. Temporal BPM analysis is implemented:
   - BPM calculated for configurable time windows (default: 10-second intervals)
   - Start BPM (first 30 seconds) and End BPM (last 30 seconds) are captured
   - Average BPM across entire track is calculated
   - Tempo stability score indicates if BPM is constant or variable
3. The analysis service can process audio files with accuracy within ±2 BPM tolerance for constant-tempo tracks.
4. BPM values and temporal data are stored as structured metadata in both PostgreSQL and Neo4j:
   - Average BPM as primary value
   - Start/End BPM for tempo changes
   - Temporal BPM array for detailed analysis (optional storage based on configuration)
   - Confidence scores for all measurements
5. Processing is optimized to handle large files efficiently (streaming/chunking for files >100MB).
6. Caching mechanism using Redis prevents re-analysis of already processed files.
7. Performance benchmarks show processing time <30 seconds for typical 5-minute tracks.
8. Unit tests validate BPM detection accuracy using reference tracks with known BPMs.
9. Special handling for:
   - Tracks with multiple tempo changes (DJ mixes, live recordings)
   - Beatless or ambient tracks (return null or very low confidence)
   - Variable tempo music (classical, jazz)

```sql
-- Existing table structure
CREATE TABLE metadata (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    recording_id UUID REFERENCES recordings(id),
    key VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
BPM metadata keys:
- `bpm_average` - Average BPM across entire track
- `bpm_start` - BPM for first 30 seconds
- `bpm_end` - BPM for last 30 seconds
- `bpm_confidence` - Overall confidence score
- `bpm_stability` - Tempo stability score
- `bpm_temporal` - JSON array of windowed BPM values (optional)
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]

#### Neo4j Graph Storage
```text
(Recording:Recording { uuid: '...' })-[:HAS_METADATA]->(BPMData:Metadata {
    key: 'bpm_average',
    value: '128',
    confidence: 0.95
})
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]

### Coding Standards
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- All Python execution via uv: `uv run python`, `uv run pytest`, etc.
- Type hints required for all function signatures
- Docstrings for all public methods
- Pre-commit hooks MUST pass before commit
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Implementation from Research
Based on Story 2.2 research, use this production-ready pattern:
```python
def detect_bpm_with_confidence(audio_path):
    """Production-ready BPM detection"""
    import essentia.standard as es

    extractor = es.RhythmExtractor2013()
    audio = es.MonoLoader(filename=audio_path)()
    bpm, beats, confidence, _, intervals = extractor(audio)

    # Apply confidence threshold
    if confidence < 0.7:
        # Try alternative algorithm
        bpm_alt = es.PercivalBpmEstimator()(audio)
        if abs(bpm - bpm_alt) < 5:
            confidence = 0.9  # High agreement increases confidence

    return {
        'bpm': round(bpm, 1),
        'confidence': confidence,
        'needs_review': confidence < 0.8
    }
```
[Source: research/audio_analysis/reports/technical_report.md]

### Message Queue Integration
The service consumes messages from RabbitMQ:
- **Queue**: `analysis_queue` (existing)
- **Message Format**: JSON with `file_path` and `recording_id`
- **Response**: Publish results to `metadata_queue`
[Source: Previous story implementation patterns]

### Redis Caching Strategy
- **Cache Key Pattern**: `bpm:{file_hash}:{version}` where:
  - file_hash is xxh128 (fast) or sha256 (secure)
  - version tracks algorithm version for cache invalidation
- **Cache Value Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "bpm_average": 128.5,
    "bpm_start": 126.0,
    "bpm_end": 130.0,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "stability": 0.88,
    "temporal_data": [...],  // optional
    "algorithm_version": "1.0",
    "processed_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- **TTL Configuration**:
  - Default: 30 days for successful analysis
  - Failed analysis: 1 hour (to allow retry)
  - Low confidence (<0.5): 7 days (for potential re-analysis)
- **Cache Invalidation Triggers**:
  - Algorithm version change
  - Manual cache flush command
  - File modification detected (different hash)
- **Cache Warming**: Pre-populate cache during off-peak hours
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Redis usage]

### Performance Requirements
- Processing time: <30 seconds for 5-minute tracks
- Memory usage: <500MB per worker
- Parallel processing: Support multiple workers
- Large file handling: Stream processing for files >100MB

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Strengths ✅
1. **Excellent Architecture Design**
   - Clean separation of concerns (BPM detection, temporal analysis, caching)
   - Proper use of dependency injection and configuration management
   - Good abstraction layers for testing

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation for missing files
   - Fallback algorithms for low confidence detection
   - Proper exception handling with logging

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Streaming support for large files
   - Parallel processing capabilities
   - Memory management with monitoring
   - Redis caching with intelligent TTL

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Clear docstrings with type hints
   - Extensive configuration documentation
   - API documentation with examples

#### Areas for Improvement 🔧

1. **Type Safety Issues** (Priority: HIGH)
   - 11 mypy errors in audio_cache.py related to Redis async/sync confusion
   - Missing proper type annotations for Optional[Redis] handling
   - Need to fix: `self.redis: Optional[Redis] = None` initialization

2. **Unit Test Reliability** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Tests using synthetic audio are producing inconsistent BPM results
   - Mock-based tests would be more reliable than synthetic audio
   - Consider using pre-recorded reference files with known BPMs

3. **Configuration Validation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Config validation could be more robust with pydantic models
   - Missing validation for edge cases (negative values, extreme ranges)

4. **Performance Monitoring** (Priority: LOW)
   - Memory guard is too strict (500MB default causes test failures)
   - Consider adaptive thresholds based on file size

5. **Cache Key Generation** (Priority: LOW)
   - XXHash fallback to SHA256 could be more explicit
   - Consider versioning strategy for algorithm updates

### Refactoring Recommendations

1. **Fix Type Annotations** (audio_cache.py)
   ```python
   # Current issue
   self.redis = None  # Type error when assigned

   # Recommended fix
   self.redis: Optional[Redis] = None
   ```

2. **Improve Test Stability**
   - Replace synthetic audio generation with actual test files
   - Use deterministic mock responses for unit tests
   - Separate integration tests from unit tests more clearly

3. **Add Input Validation**
   ```python
   def detect_bpm(self, audio_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       # Add validation
       if not audio_path:
           raise ValueError("Audio path cannot be empty")
       # ... rest of implementation
   ```

### Security Review
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Proper path validation to prevent traversal attacks
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs
- ✅ Redis connection uses configurable credentials
- ⚠️ Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints

### Performance Review
- ✅ Efficient streaming for large files
- ✅ Parallel processing implemented correctly
- ✅ Memory management with psutil monitoring
- ✅ Redis caching reduces redundant processing
- ⚠️ Memory limits may be too conservative for production

### Test Coverage Analysis
| Module | Coverage | Target | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| bpm_detector.py | 90% | 80% | ✅ PASS |
| temporal_analyzer.py | 84% | 80% | ✅ PASS |

class RedisCache(CacheStrategy):
    # Current implementation
    pass

class InMemoryCache(CacheStrategy):
    # For testing without Redis
    pass
```

#### 2. Improve Error Recovery
```python
class BPMDetectionError(Exception):
    """Custom exception with recovery hints."""
    def __init__(self, message: str, recovery_action: str):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.recovery_action = recovery_action

# Usage
if confidence < threshold:
    raise BPMDetectionError(
        "Low confidence detection",
        recovery_action="Try manual BPM tapping or different algorithm"
    )
```
