## Project Structure Notes
This story enhances the existing analysis_service with optimization and monitoring capabilities. The implementation should integrate with the existing service architecture established in Stories 2.1-2.5, following the same patterns for dependency injection, configuration management, and error handling. The monitoring and optimization components should be modular and not disrupt existing functionality.
