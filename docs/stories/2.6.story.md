## Story Statement
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** an optimized and observable analysis pipeline,
**so that** I can process large music collections efficiently and troubleshoot issues quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Queue-based priority system allows high-priority files to be analyzed first.
2. Batch processing mode can analyze multiple files in parallel (configurable concurrency).
3. Progress tracking provides real-time status of analysis queue and individual file processing.
4. Comprehensive logging with structured format enables debugging and monitoring.
5. Metrics are exposed for processing time, success/failure rates, and queue depths.
6. Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures when external services are unavailable.
7. Graceful shutdown ensures no data loss when service is stopped.
8. Health check endpoints report service status and dependency availability.
9. Performance tests demonstrate ability to process 1000+ files per hour.
10. Documentation includes tuning guide for different hardware configurations.

**Infrastructure & Architecture Context**:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Services communicate asynchronously via RabbitMQ message queue
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services publish/subscribe to messages, decoupling services for resilience
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access logic behind clean interfaces
- **Polyglot Persistence**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Neo4j for graph analysis, Redis for caching
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Error Handling Requirements**:
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Use middleware or decorator in each service for consistent exception processing
- **Correlation IDs**: Unique IDs passed through all RabbitMQ messages for end-to-end tracing
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement exponential backoff for transient errors
- **Connection Management**: Retry mechanism with backoff policy for datastore connections
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Required to prevent cascade failures when external services unavailable
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Logging Standards**:
- **Structured Logs**: Use Python logging library with JSON format output
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Required Context**: Timestamp, service name, log level, correlation ID in every log message
- **Performance Logging**: Include timing information for critical operations
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]

**Infrastructure Requirements**:
- **Containerization**: Each service must have its own Dockerfile
- **Docker Compose**: Infrastructure defined in infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline configuration in .github/workflows/
- **Health Checks**: Required for container orchestration and monitoring
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Framework**: pytest with `uv run pytest` execution
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Test Location**: tests/unit/analysis_service/test_pipeline_optimization/
- **Performance Tests**: Required to validate 1000+ files/hour processing capability
- **Integration Tests**: Use Dockerized environments for real datastores

## Project Structure Notes
This story enhances the existing analysis_service with optimization and monitoring capabilities. The implementation should integrate with the existing service architecture established in Stories 2.1-2.5, following the same patterns for dependency injection, configuration management, and error handling. The monitoring and optimization components should be modular and not disrupt existing functionality.
