# Story 7.1: Implement Watchdog Library

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** the file_watcher to use the watchdog library properly,
**so that** file monitoring is reliable and tracks complete file lifecycle

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Watchdog observers are properly initialized
2. All file events are captured (create, modify, delete, move, rename)
3. Observer threads are managed correctly
4. Graceful shutdown of observers
5. Unit tests for watchdog event handlers
6. Event types are properly identified and propagated

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Review current file watching implementation (AC: 1,2)
  - [ ] Analyze existing file_watcher service code
  - [ ] Identify where watchdog is imported but not used
  - [ ] Document current file monitoring approach
  - [ ] Create inventory of file events that need to be captured

- [ ] Task 2: Replace custom watching with watchdog observers (AC: 1,2)
  - [ ] Remove custom file watching logic
  - [ ] Initialize watchdog Observer instance
  - [ ] Configure observer for target directory
  - [ ] Set up recursive monitoring for subdirectories

- [ ] Task 3: Implement event handlers (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Create FileSystemEventHandler subclass
  - [ ] Implement on_created() for new files
  - [ ] Implement on_modified() for file changes
  - [ ] Implement on_deleted() for removed files
  - [ ] Implement on_moved() for moved/renamed files
  - [ ] Distinguish between move and rename in on_moved()
  - [ ] Add event_type field to all messages

- [ ] Task 4: Manage observer lifecycle (AC: 3,4)
  - [ ] Implement proper observer start sequence
  - [ ] Add graceful shutdown handler (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
  - [ ] Ensure observer.stop() and observer.join() on shutdown
  - [ ] Add timeout handling for observer shutdown

- [ ] Task 5: Add logging and error handling (AC: 3,4)
  - [ ] Add detailed logging for all file events
  - [ ] Log observer state changes (start/stop)
  - [ ] Implement error recovery for observer failures
  - [ ] Add health check for observer status

- [ ] Task 6: Write comprehensive unit tests (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test observer initialization
  - [ ] Test each event handler (create, modify, delete, move)
  - [ ] Test graceful shutdown behavior
  - [ ] Test error handling and recovery
  - [ ] Ensure 80% code coverage minimum

- [ ] Task 7: Integration testing (AC: All)
  - [ ] Test with real file operations
  - [ ] Verify RabbitMQ message publishing
  - [ ] Test with various file types and sizes
  - [ ] Validate performance under load

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher service: `services/file_watcher/`
- Source code: `services/file_watcher/src/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/file_watcher/`
- Dependencies: `services/file_watcher/pyproject.toml`

#### Technical Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- MUST use watchdog library (currently imported but not used)
- Replace ALL custom file watching logic
- Proper observer lifecycle management required
- Support for all standard file operations

#### Watchdog Implementation Pattern
```python
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
import os

class TracktionEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_created(self, event):
        if not event.is_directory:
            self.send_event('created', event.src_path)

    def on_modified(self, event):
        if not event.is_directory:
            self.send_event('modified', event.src_path)

    def on_deleted(self, event):
        if not event.is_directory:
            self.send_event('deleted', event.src_path)

    def on_moved(self, event):
        if not event.is_directory:
            # Determine if it's a rename or move
            src_dir = os.path.dirname(event.src_path)
            dest_dir = os.path.dirname(event.dest_path)

            if src_dir == dest_dir:
                self.send_event('renamed', event.dest_path,
                              old_path=event.src_path)
            else:
                self.send_event('moved', event.dest_path,
                              old_path=event.src_path)

    def send_event(self, event_type, file_path, **kwargs):
        message = {
            'event_type': event_type,
            'file_path': file_path,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            **kwargs
        }
        # Send to RabbitMQ
        publish_message(message)

# Initialize and start observer
observer = Observer()
observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=True)
observer.start()
```

#### Critical Implementation Notes
- Watchdog library is already in dependencies but not being used
- Must handle graceful shutdown properly to avoid hanging threads
- File events should be published to RabbitMQ for processing
- Each event should include file path, event type, and timestamp

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Unit tests must use `uv run pytest`
- Test files in `tests/unit/file_watcher/`
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Pre-commit hooks must pass
- All tests must pass before story completion

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Python 3.13
- Use `uv run` for all Python execution
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Type hints required for all functions
- Proper error handling and logging
