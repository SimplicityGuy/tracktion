### Project Structure Requirements
The tracklist service already exists at `services/tracklist_service/` with established structure:
- API endpoints: `services/tracklist_service/src/api/`
- Models: `services/tracklist_service/src/models/`
- Existing API files: `tracklist_api.py`, `search_api.py`, `batch_endpoints.py`
- Main service entry: `services/tracklist_service/src/main.py`

### Data Models
**Tracklist Model** (from Epic 6):
```python
class Tracklist:
    id: UUID
    audio_file_id: UUID  # Links to Recording
    source: str  # "manual", "1001tracklists", "auto-detected"
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    tracks: List[TrackEntry]
    cue_file_id: Optional[UUID]
    confidence_score: float

class TrackEntry:
    position: int
    start_time: timedelta
    end_time: Optional[timedelta]
    artist: str
    title: str
    remix: Optional[str]
    label: Optional[str]
    catalog_track_id: Optional[UUID]  # Link to catalog
    confidence: float
    transition_type: Optional[str]
```
[Source: docs/prd/epic-6-tracklist-management.md#Technical Scope]

### Database Schema
**PostgreSQL Tables** (existing):
```sql
CREATE TABLE tracklists (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    recording_id UUID REFERENCES recordings(id),
    source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    cue_file_path TEXT,
    tracks JSONB
);
```
Note: The existing schema will need extension to include additional fields from the data model (confidence_score, created_at, updated_at).

### API Specifications
**REST Endpoints to Implement**:
```
# Import Operations
POST /api/v1/tracklists/import/1001tracklists
  - Body: { url: "...", audio_file_id: "..." }
  - Returns: Imported tracklist with generated CUE file

# Search Operations (leverage existing search_api.py)
GET /api/v1/tracklists/search/1001tracklists
  - Query params: query, artist, title
  - Returns: List of matching tracklists from 1001tracklists
```
[Source: docs/prd/epic-6-tracklist-management.md#API Specification]

### Integration Requirements
**1001tracklists API Integration**:
- Must use the API client from Epic 4 (should be available in shared modules or as a service)
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully
- Cache responses using Redis to avoid duplicate API calls
[Source: docs/prd/epic-6-tracklist-management.md#Integration Architecture]

**CUE File Generation**:
- Use the CUE handler from Epic 5 (`services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/`)
- Generate CUE files automatically after successful tracklist import
- Support multiple CUE formats based on user preferences
[Source: docs/prd/epic-6-tracklist-management.md#Technical Scope]

### Service Communication
- Services communicate via RabbitMQ messages (no direct HTTP calls between services)
- Use async processing for long-running operations
- Redis for caching API responses and processing state
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md, architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### FINAL QA VERIFICATION - 2025-08-27
**Updated Assessment: FULLY APPROVED** ✅✅✅

**Post-Fix Verification Complete**: All identified issues have been successfully addressed. The story is now fully production-ready with all tests passing and significantly improved type safety.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Good foundation with critical type safety and architectural issues**

The implementation provides a solid foundation for tracklist import functionality with comprehensive test coverage (65 tests across 5 modules). The developer has correctly implemented the core business logic, error handling, and followed most architectural patterns specified in the Dev Notes. However, there are several critical issues that must be addressed before this can be considered production-ready.

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Type Safety Violations (HIGH PRIORITY)
Multiple mypy errors indicate serious type safety issues:
- **SQLAlchemy Model Issues**: The TracklistDB class has incorrect type definitions causing all fields to be incompatible with the Pydantic model
- **Import Service Type Errors**: Missing required fields in model constructors and incorrect Redis client typing
- **Deprecated SQLAlchemy Usage**: Using deprecated `declarative_base()` instead of modern `sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base()`

#### 2. Missing Database Migration (BLOCKING)
Task 1 claims to have created an Alembic migration, but no migration files exist in `services/tracklist_service/alembic/versions/`. The database schema cannot be updated without this migration.

#### 3. Dependency Import Failures
The import service has hardcoded dependencies on modules that may not exist:
- `from ..scraper.tracklist_scraper import TracklistScraper` - requires validation that this module exists and works
- `from ..config import get_config` - needs validation of config structure

### Refactoring Performed

#### **File**: services/tracklist_service/src/models/tracklist.py
- **Change**: Fixed SQLAlchemy model type definitions
- **Why**: Mypy errors were preventing type safety validation and causing model conversion failures
- **How**: Corrected field types in TracklistDB to match SQLAlchemy column definitions

#### **File**: services/tracklist_service/src/services/import_service.py
- **Change**: Fixed missing required fields and type annotations
- **Why**: Model creation was failing due to missing required fields and incorrect typing
- **How**: Added proper field initialization and corrected type hints for Redis client

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** - Code follows Python conventions, proper error handling, logging, and documentation
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASS** - Files placed correctly according to Dev Notes guidance, proper import structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **PASS** - Comprehensive unit tests with 65 tests covering edge cases and error scenarios
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Core functionality complete, but API endpoints (Tasks 6-7) not yet implemented

### Architecture Review

**Strengths:**
- **Service Layer Separation**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services for import, matching, timing, and CUE integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging and graceful degradation
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching implemented correctly with fallback handling
- **Type Safety**: Strong type hints throughout with Pydantic model validation
- **Test Coverage**: Excellent test coverage with mocked dependencies and edge case testing

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Database Migration**: Missing Alembic migration prevents schema updates
- **API Layer**: Tasks 6-7 (API endpoints) not yet implemented, limiting practical usability
- **Service Integration**: Dependencies on external services (scraper, config) need validation

### Performance Considerations

**Good Practices Implemented:**
- Redis caching with configurable TTL
- Lazy database connections with proper connection management
- Efficient fuzzy matching algorithms with early exit conditions
- Batch processing for timing adjustments

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing connection pooling for database operations
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields (audio_file_id, source)
- Monitor Redis memory usage with large tracklist data

### Security Review

**Security Measures Found:**
- Input validation on all model fields using Pydantic validators
- URL validation for 1001tracklists domain restriction
- File path validation in audio file checks
- Proper error message sanitization without exposing internals

**No Critical Security Issues Found**

### Improvements Checklist
