## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### API Structure
[Source: Architecture context and service structure]
The API layer will be implemented across services:
- Each service will expose its own API endpoints
- Services communicate via RabbitMQ, not direct HTTP
- API gateway pattern for external access

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.13 with async/await
- FastAPI for API framework (implicit from async requirements)
- Uvicorn for ASGI server
- Docker for containerization

#### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
API endpoints will be in each service:
- `services/file_watcher/src/api/`
- `services/cataloging_service/src/api/`
- `services/analysis_service/src/api/`
- `services/tracklist_service/src/api/`

#### Async Framework Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- FastAPI with async def endpoints
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- WebSocket support for real-time
- Streaming responses for large data
- Proper timeout handling

#### Performance Targets
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- Handle >1000 concurrent requests
- Response time <100ms for 95th percentile
- WebSocket connections >500 concurrent
- Request timeout: 30s default
- Streaming chunk size: 8KB

### Critical Implementation Details

#### FastAPI Async Configuration
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    # Handle WebSocket connection
```

#### Streaming Response Pattern
- Use async generators for data streaming
- Chunk size optimization for network efficiency
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Support for partial content requests

#### WebSocket Architecture
- Connection pool management
- Event-driven message broadcasting
- Heartbeat/ping-pong for connection health
- Graceful reconnection handling

#### Error Handling Strategy
- Global exception handlers
- Request ID in all responses
- Structured error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test files in `tests/unit/*/api/`
- Use `uv run pytest` for execution
- Test with httpx for async clients
- WebSocket testing with pytest-asyncio
- Load testing for concurrent requests
- Minimum 80% code coverage

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use `uv run` for all Python commands
- Type hints for all async functions
- Proper async context managers
- Environment variables for config
- No direct service-to-service HTTP calls

### API Design Principles
- RESTful resource naming
- Consistent error response format
- Version in URL path (/v1/)
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Rate limiting headers

### Security Considerations
- Authentication middleware (future)
- CORS configuration
- Request validation
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting per client
