## Implementation Guidance

### Critical Path Considerations
1. **Environment Setup First**: Ensure all libraries can be installed and work with Python 3.13
2. **Quick Wins**: Start with basic BPM detection to validate approach
3. **Model Download**: Essentia models are large - test download/caching strategy early
4. **Benchmark Consistency**: Use same audio files across all tests for fair comparison

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Version Conflicts**: Some audio libraries may have conflicting dependencies
2. **Memory Issues**: Large models + large audio files can exhaust memory
3. **Accuracy Assumptions**: Don't assume one library is best for all genres
4. **GPU Dependencies**: Some libraries require CUDA - document requirements clearly
5. **Sample Bias**: Test with diverse music genres, not just electronic/pop

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. Set up research environment with all libraries
2. Create common test dataset with ground truth
3. Implement BPM detection comparison first (simpler, faster)
4. Then tackle mood/genre models (more complex, larger)
5. Key detection can be done in parallel
6. Run comprehensive benchmarks after individual tests
7. Write report with all evidence gathered

## Project Structure Notes
The research directory should be self-contained with its own dependencies and documentation. While it's separate from the main application code, findings will directly inform the implementation of Stories 2.3 and 2.4. Consider creating a separate Docker image for research to avoid polluting the main application dependencies.
