#### Async Libraries to Implement
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]

- **asyncio**: Core async/await functionality
- **pytest-asyncio**: For async testing

#### Performance Targets
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- Handle >100 concurrent file operations
- Response time <100ms for 95th percentile
- Support for thousands of files without blocking
- Connection pool of 20-50 for external services

#### Critical Implementation Details
- Use semaphores to limit concurrent operations (max 100)
- Implement proper cleanup handlers for async resources
- Use asyncio.gather() for parallel operations
- Thread pool executor for CPU-bound metadata extraction
- Proper error propagation in async context

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test files must be named `test_*.py`
- Located in `tests/unit/file_watcher/`
- Must use `uv run pytest` for test execution
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- All tests must pass before story completion
- Use pytest-asyncio for async test support
- Pre-commit hooks must pass: ruff, mypy, formatting

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Always use `uv run` for Python execution
- Never use plain `python` or `pip` commands
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- All async functions must have proper type hints
- Use latest stable versions of dependencies
- Configuration from environment variables only
- Inter-service communication via RabbitMQ only

### Migration Strategy Notes
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- Maintain compatibility layer during transition
- Parallel testing of sync/async versions
- Feature flags for rollback capability
- Benchmark before and after implementation
- Incremental refactoring approach

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The async file watching implementation demonstrates excellent understanding of asynchronous programming patterns. The code is well-structured with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and effective use of concurrency controls. The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with robust testing coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: services/file_watcher/pyproject.toml
  - **Change**: Removed duplicate aiofiles entry in non-standard dependency-groups section
  - **Why**: Dependency was already correctly listed in main dependencies, duplicate caused confusion
  - **How**: Simplifies dependency management and prevents version conflicts

- **File**: services/file_watcher/src/async_file_watcher.py
  - **Change**: Added error handling to _calculate_hashes_async method
  - **Why**: Method could throw unhandled IOError/OSError on file access issues
  - **How**: Returns (None, None) on error with proper logging, prevents task failure cascade

- **File**: services/file_watcher/src/async_metadata_extractor.py
  - **Change**: Added async context manager support (__aenter__/__aexit__)
  - **Why**: Ensures proper cleanup of ThreadPoolExecutor resources
  - **How**: Allows safe usage with `async with` pattern, preventing resource leaks

- **File**: services/file_watcher/src/async_message_publisher.py
  - **Change**: Added automatic reconnection logic when channel is closed
  - **Why**: Improves resilience to temporary RabbitMQ connection issues
  - **How**: Detects closed channels and attempts reconnection before failing

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Properly uses uv, follows line length limits, excellent type hints
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in services/file_watcher/src/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive async tests with edge cases, performance benchmarks
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed pyproject.toml dependency configuration issue
[x] Added error handling for hash calculation failures
[x] Implemented context manager for metadata extractor cleanup
[x] Added connection recovery logic to message publisher
[ ] Consider implementing exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
[ ] Consider adding metrics collection for monitoring file processing rates
[ ] Document the semaphore limit configuration in deployment guide

### Security Review

No security issues found. The implementation properly:
- Validates file paths and extensions
- Handles file permissions gracefully
- Uses secure hash algorithms (SHA256)
- Protects against resource exhaustion with semaphore limits

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance characteristics:
- Semaphore properly limits concurrent operations (configurable, default 100)
- Efficient 8KB chunk size for file reading
- Thread pool for CPU-bound metadata extraction
- Connection pooling for RabbitMQ
- Test demonstrates handling 1000+ concurrent events efficiently
- Cache implementation for metadata to reduce redundant processing

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation is production-ready with excellent async patterns, comprehensive testing, and robust error handling. Minor improvements suggested above are nice-to-haves for future iterations.
