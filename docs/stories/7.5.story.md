# Story 7.5: Handle File Lifecycle Events System-Wide

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system maintaining data consistency,
**I want** file deletions, moves, and renames to be handled throughout the system,
**so that** the database stays in sync with the file system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. File deletion events trigger database cleanup
2. File move events update file paths in database
3. File rename events update filenames in database
4. Cascading deletes remove related metadata and analysis
5. Soft-delete option available for recovery
6. All downstream services handle lifecycle events properly
7. No orphaned data remains after file removal
8. Referential integrity maintained across all services

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Update message queue event structure (AC: 1,2,3,6)
  - [ ] Add event_type field to all messages
  - [ ] Define event types: created, modified, deleted, moved, renamed
  - [ ] Include old_path for move/rename events
  - [ ] Update message schema documentation
  - [ ] Version the message format for compatibility

- [ ] Task 2: Update cataloging_service for lifecycle events (AC: 1,2,3,4,7)
  - [ ] Handle 'deleted' events - remove recording from database
  - [ ] Handle 'moved' events - update file_path
  - [ ] Handle 'renamed' events - update file_name
  - [ ] Implement cascade deletion for related metadata
  - [ ] Add transaction support for atomic updates

- [ ] Task 3: Update analysis_service for cleanup (AC: 1,4,7)
  - [ ] Handle 'deleted' events - remove analysis data
  - [ ] Clean up Neo4j relationships for deleted files
  - [ ] Clear Redis cache entries for deleted files
  - [ ] Handle 'moved/renamed' - update references
  - [ ] Ensure no orphaned analysis data remains

- [ ] Task 4: Update tracklist_service handling (AC: 1,4,6,7)
  - [ ] Handle deleted recordings in tracklists
  - [ ] Update file references for moved/renamed files
  - [ ] Clean up orphaned tracklist entries
  - [ ] Update CUE file paths as needed

- [ ] Task 5: Implement soft-delete mechanism (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add deleted_at timestamp column to recordings table
  - [ ] Create soft-delete flag in configuration
  - [ ] Implement recovery mechanism for soft-deleted files
  - [ ] Add periodic cleanup for old soft-deleted records
  - [ ] Document soft-delete behavior

- [ ] Task 6: Add referential integrity checks (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Implement foreign key constraints where missing
  - [ ] Add database triggers for cascade operations
  - [ ] Create integrity validation script
  - [ ] Add monitoring for orphaned records

- [ ] Task 7: End-to-end testing of lifecycle events (AC: All)
  - [ ] Test file creation flow through all services
  - [ ] Test file deletion with cascade cleanup
  - [ ] Test file move updates all references
  - [ ] Test file rename updates all references
  - [ ] Test soft-delete and recovery
  - [ ] Verify no orphaned data after operations
  - [ ] Performance test with bulk operations

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher: `services/file_watcher/`
- Cataloging service: `services/cataloging_service/`
- Analysis service: `services/analysis_service/`
- Tracklist service: `services/tracklist_service/`
- Shared types: `shared/core_types/`

#### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]
PostgreSQL tables affected:
- recordings (main table for files)
- metadata (linked to recordings)
- tracklists (linked to recordings)

Neo4j relationships affected:
- Recording nodes and all relationships
- Metadata nodes linked to recordings
- Track relationships

#### Message Queue Structure
[Source: Epic 7 requirements]
New message format:
```json
{
  "event_type": "created|modified|deleted|moved|renamed",
  "file_path": "/current/path/to/file.mp3",
  "old_path": "/old/path/to/file.mp3",  // for moved/renamed
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T10:30:00Z",
  "instance_id": "watcher1",
  "sha256_hash": "...",  // not for deleted
  "xxh128_hash": "..."   // not for deleted
}
```

#### Cascade Deletion Strategy
1. When file is deleted:
   - Remove from recordings table
   - Cascade to metadata table (FK constraint)
   - Remove from Neo4j graph
   - Clear Redis cache entries
   - Update or remove from tracklists
   - Clean up any analysis results

2. When file is moved/renamed:
   - Update file_path/file_name in recordings
   - No cascade needed (just update)
   - Update Neo4j node properties
   - Invalidate Redis cache
   - Update tracklist references

#### Soft-Delete Implementation
```sql
-- Add soft-delete column
ALTER TABLE recordings
ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Query for active records
SELECT * FROM recordings
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Soft delete
UPDATE recordings
SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE file_path = ?;

-- Recovery
UPDATE recordings
SET deleted_at = NULL
WHERE file_path = ?;
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Unit tests for each service's event handlers
- Integration tests for full lifecycle flows
- Test with Docker compose multi-service setup
- Verify data consistency after operations
- Performance testing with many files

### Critical Implementation Notes
- Must maintain backward compatibility during rollout
- Consider using database transactions for consistency
- Log all lifecycle events for audit trail
- Monitor for failed cascade operations
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### Downstream Service Updates Required

#### cataloging_service
- New event handlers for each event type
- Update existing create logic to check event_type
- Implement delete handler
- Implement move/rename handlers

#### analysis_service
- Clean up analysis data on delete
- Update references on move/rename
- Clear cache entries appropriately

#### tracklist_service
- Handle missing recordings gracefully
- Update file references in tracklists
- Regenerate CUE files if needed
