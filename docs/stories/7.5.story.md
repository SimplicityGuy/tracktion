# Story 7.5: Handle File Lifecycle Events System-Wide

## Status
Partial Complete

## Story
**As a** system maintaining data consistency,
**I want** file deletions, moves, and renames to be handled throughout the system,
**so that** the database stays in sync with the file system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. File deletion events trigger database cleanup
2. File move events update file paths in database
3. File rename events update filenames in database
4. Cascading deletes remove related metadata and analysis
5. Soft-delete option available for recovery
6. All downstream services handle lifecycle events properly
7. No orphaned data remains after file removal
8. Referential integrity maintained across all services

  - [x] Create soft-delete flag in configuration
  - [x] Implement recovery mechanism for soft-deleted files
  - [x] Add periodic cleanup for old soft-deleted records
  - [x] Document soft-delete behavior

- [ ] Task 6: Add referential integrity checks (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Implement foreign key constraints where missing
  - [ ] Add database triggers for cascade operations
  - [ ] Create integrity validation script
  - [ ] Add monitoring for orphaned records

- [ ] Task 7: End-to-end testing of lifecycle events (AC: All)
  - [ ] Test file creation flow through all services
  - [ ] Test file deletion with cascade cleanup
  - [ ] Test file move updates all references
  - [ ] Test file rename updates all references
  - [ ] Test soft-delete and recovery
  - [ ] Verify no orphaned data after operations
  - [ ] Performance test with bulk operations

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher: `services/file_watcher/`
- Cataloging service: `services/cataloging_service/`
- Analysis service: `services/analysis_service/`
- Tracklist service: `services/tracklist_service/`
- Shared types: `shared/core_types/`

#### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]
PostgreSQL tables affected:
- recordings (main table for files)
- metadata (linked to recordings)
- tracklists (linked to recordings)

Neo4j relationships affected:
- Recording nodes and all relationships
- Metadata nodes linked to recordings
- Track relationships

#### Message Queue Structure
[Source: Epic 7 requirements]
New message format:
```json
{
  "event_type": "created|modified|deleted|moved|renamed",
  "file_path": "/current/path/to/file.mp3",
  "old_path": "/old/path/to/file.mp3",  // for moved/renamed
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T10:30:00Z",
  "instance_id": "watcher1",
  "sha256_hash": "...",  // not for deleted
  "xxh128_hash": "..."   // not for deleted
}
```

#### Cascade Deletion Strategy
1. When file is deleted:
   - Remove from recordings table
   - Cascade to metadata table (FK constraint)
   - Remove from Neo4j graph
   - Clear Redis cache entries
   - Update or remove from tracklists
   - Clean up any analysis results

2. When file is moved/renamed:
   - Update file_path/file_name in recordings
   - No cascade needed (just update)
   - Update Neo4j node properties
   - Invalidate Redis cache
   - Update tracklist references

#### Soft-Delete Implementation
```sql
-- Add soft-delete column
ALTER TABLE recordings
ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Query for active records
SELECT * FROM recordings
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Soft delete
UPDATE recordings
SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE file_path = ?;

-- Recovery
UPDATE recordings
SET deleted_at = NULL
WHERE file_path = ?;
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Unit tests for each service's event handlers
- Integration tests for full lifecycle flows
- Test with Docker compose multi-service setup
- Verify data consistency after operations
- Performance testing with many files

### Critical Implementation Notes
- Must maintain backward compatibility during rollout
- Consider using database transactions for consistency
- Log all lifecycle events for audit trail
- Monitor for failed cascade operations
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### Downstream Service Updates Required

#### cataloging_service
- New event handlers for each event type
- Update existing create logic to check event_type
- Implement delete handler
- Implement move/rename handlers

#### analysis_service
- Clean up analysis data on delete
- Update references on move/rename
- Clear cache entries appropriately

#### tracklist_service
- Handle missing recordings gracefully
- Update file references in tracklists
- Regenerate CUE files if needed

### Debug Log References
- Successfully updated message queue event structure in file_watcher service
- Added soft-delete mechanism to Recording model
- Created file lifecycle service for tracklist service
- Implemented file event consumer for tracklist service
- Created and tested Alembic migration for soft-delete column
- All unit tests passing for new functionality

### Completion Notes List
- Task 1: Message queue event structure updated to support all lifecycle events with proper hash handling
- Task 2: Cataloging service created with full lifecycle event handling using shared FileLifecycleService
- Task 4: Tracklist service now handles file lifecycle events properly with FileLifecycleService
- Task 5: Soft-delete mechanism fully implemented with recovery and cleanup functionality
- Tasks 3, 6, 7: Not completed - analysis_service cleanup partial, referential integrity and end-to-end testing remain
