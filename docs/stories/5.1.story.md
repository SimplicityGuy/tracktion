## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Migrations**: Alembic for schema management
- **Testing**: pytest framework
- **Code Standards**: ruff for linting, mypy for type checking

#### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The CUE handler will be part of the analysis_service:
- Location: `services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/`

#### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-refined-and-finalized.md#tracklist]
The Tracklist model already exists with:
- `cue_file_path`: String field for storing generated CUE file path
- `tracks`: JSONB array containing track information (title, artist, start_time)
- This story focuses on parsing CUE files to populate these existing structures

[Source: shared/core_types/src/models.py#L104-139]
Existing Tracklist SQLAlchemy model:
- Uses PostgreSQL JSONB for tracks storage
- Has `validate_tracks()` method checking for required keys (title, artist, start_time)
- Related to Recording model via foreign key

#### CUE Specification Details from Epic
[Source: docs/prd/epic-5-cue-file-handler.md#L74-153]

**Time Format (Wikipedia Specification)**:
- Format: MM:SS:FF (minute:second:frame)
- Frame Rate: 75 frames per second
- 1 second = 75 frames
- All times cumulative from start of file

**Essential Commands**:
- FILE: filename and format (WAVE, MP3, BINARY, MOTOROLA, AIFF)
- TRACK: number (01-99) and type (AUDIO, CDG, MODE1/2048, etc.)
- INDEX: track position (01 required, 00 for pregap)

**Metadata Commands**:
- REM: Comments and extensions
- TITLE: Max 80 chars for CD-Text
- PERFORMER: Max 80 chars
- SONGWRITER: Track songwriter
- CDTEXTFILE: External CD-Text reference

**Extended REM Commands**:
- REM GENRE, DATE, DISCID, COMMENT
- REM DISCNUMBER (1-15 for Kodi)
- REM COMPOSER
- REM REPLAYGAIN_* fields

**Key Discrepancies to Handle**:
1. Frame range: 75 frames/second (some specs show 0-74 range)
2. FLAC files commonly use WAVE type
3. Alternative comment syntax: REM, ";", "//"
4. Command repetition allowed
5. Extended ASCII support beyond UTF-8

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest with `uv run pytest` execution
- **Test Files**: Named `test_*.py` in `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/`
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Required**: All unit tests must pass before task completion
- **Execution**: Run tests after each task with `uv run pytest tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/ -v`

### Code Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **MANDATORY**: Use `uv run python` instead of `python` or `python3`
- **MANDATORY**: Use `uv run pytest` for running tests
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Must pass before committing (ruff, mypy, etc.)
- **Line length**: Maximum 120 characters
- **Type hints**: Required with mypy validation
