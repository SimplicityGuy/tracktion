## Security Considerations
- API keys stored hashed (bcrypt/argon2)
- JWT secrets rotated regularly
- Rate limit bypasses require admin approval
- All authentication failures logged
- Suspicious patterns trigger alerts

## Performance Targets
- Authentication overhead: < 100ms
- Rate limit check: < 10ms
- Usage tracking: < 5ms overhead
- Key validation: < 50ms
- Quota check: < 20ms

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: API key leakage
  - **Mitigation**: Key rotation, automatic expiry, usage monitoring
- **Risk**: DDoS attacks
  - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, IP blocking, CDN protection
- **Risk**: Quota exhaustion attacks
  - **Mitigation**: Abuse detection, automatic blocking

## Notes
- Consider implementing API key tiers with different permissions
- Future: Add GraphQL support with query complexity limiting
- Consider partner API keys with special rates
