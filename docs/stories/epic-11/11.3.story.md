## Investigation Queries

### Find Incomplete Tasks
```bash
# Find unchecked tasks in story files
rg "\[ \]" docs/stories/ --type md

# Find TODO/FIXME in implementation
rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX" services/ --type py

# Find placeholder or mock implementations
rg "mock|fake|dummy|placeholder|stub" services/ --type py -i

# Find NotImplementedError
rg "NotImplementedError|raise NotImplemented" services/ --type py

# Find pass statements that might be placeholders
rg "^\s*pass\s*$" services/ --type py
```

### Verify Implementation Status
```python
# Check for incomplete test coverage
uv run pytest --cov=services --cov-report=term-missing

# Find skipped tests
uv run pytest -v | grep -i skip

# Check for disabled tests
rg "@pytest.mark.skip|@unittest.skip" tests/
```

## Story Review Checklist Template

For each story, verify:
- [ ] All tasks marked complete are actually done
- [ ] Code implements the described functionality
- [ ] Tests exist and pass for the feature
- [ ] Documentation reflects implementation
- [ ] No placeholder code remains
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Known Incomplete Items (To Be Updated)

### From Initial Analysis:
1. Story 10.5: Real-time data processing subtask
2. Tracklist Service: Mock audio service call
3. Cache Service: Content generation TODO
4. Various validation rules with XXX comments

### Categories of Incompleteness:
- **Critical**: Features that block production use
- **Important**: Features that limit functionality
- **Minor**: Polish items and optimizations
- **Deferred**: Intentionally postponed features
