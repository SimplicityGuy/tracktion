# Story 11.1: Pragma Audit and Removal

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team
**I want** minimal pragma usage in the codebase
**So that** we're fixing issues rather than hiding them

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete audit of ALL mypy, ruff, and linting pragma directives
2. Validate each pragma exception for necessity
3. Fix ALL issues where a proper solution exists
4. Remove unnecessary suppressions that can be properly fixed
5. Fix underlying type checking and linting issues
6. Document remaining pragmas with clear technical justification
7. Create pragma usage guidelines for exceptional cases only
8. Zero new pragmas without explicit justification

## Technical Notes

### Common Pragma Patterns to Fix
```python
# Instead of:
from alembic import context  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
# Fix with:
from alembic import context  # Alembic adds attributes at runtime

# Instead of:
X, y = trainer._prepare_training_data(data)  # noqa: N806
# Fix with proper naming or document ML convention:
X, y = trainer._prepare_training_data(data)  # X is standard ML convention for features

# Instead of:
result = complex_function()  # type: ignore[no-untyped-call]
# Fix with:
# Add type hints to complex_function or create stub file
```

### Search Commands
```bash
# Find all pragmas
rg "# type: ignore|# noqa|# pragma|# pylint|# mypy" --type py

# Count by type
rg "# type: ignore" --type py -c | wc -l
rg "# noqa" --type py -c | wc -l

# Find specific pragma types
rg "# type: ignore\[.*?\]" --type py -o | sort | uniq -c
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Run strict type checking
uv run mypy services/ --strict

# Run comprehensive linting
uv run ruff check services/ --no-fix

# Pre-commit validation
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Dependencies
- All services must have tests passing before pragma removal
- Type stubs may need updates for third-party libraries
- Some framework-specific pragmas may be unavoidable

- [x] Guidelines created and approved
- [x] CI/CD validates pragma usage
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Type checking clean (except documented exceptions)
- [x] Linting clean (except documented exceptions)
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Code review approved

- **Systematic Approach**: Proper categorization, prioritization, and remediation strategies
- **Genuine Code Improvements**: Modern SQLAlchemy API migration, proper singleton patterns, quality type stubs
- **Process Integration**: Well-designed CI/CD and pre-commit integration

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - the implementation quality is exceptional. All code changes follow best practices:

- **SQLAlchemy Migration**: Modern `select()` API consistently applied with proper type casting
- **Singleton Patterns**: Thread-safe, well-designed implementations replacing global variables
- **Type Stubs**: Comprehensive stubs for external libraries properly configured
- **Async Patterns**: Proper async/await with consistent type handling

### Compliance Check
