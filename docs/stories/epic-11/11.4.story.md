## Test Commands

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=services --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Service-specific coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit/analysis_service --cov=services/analysis_service

# Find uncovered lines
uv run pytest --cov=services --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate coverage badge
uv run coverage-badge -o coverage.svg
```

### Test Execution
```bash

## Common Test Issues to Fix

### Async Test Issues
```python

    result = async_function()  # Will fail

# Good: Proper async test
async def test_async_function():
    result = await async_function()
```

### Mock Issues
```python
# Bad: Incorrect mock path
@patch('module.function')

# Good: Mock where it's used
@patch('services.service.module.function')
```

### Fixture Issues
```python
# Bad: Shared mutable fixtures
@pytest.fixture
def data():
    return []  # Shared between tests

# Good: Factory fixture
@pytest.fixture
def data():
    return lambda: []  # New instance each time
```
