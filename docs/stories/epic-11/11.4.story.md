## Test Commands

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=services --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Service-specific coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit/analysis_service --cov=services/analysis_service

# Find uncovered lines
uv run pytest --cov=services --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate coverage badge
uv run coverage-badge -o coverage.svg
```

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run with markers
uv run pytest -m "not slow" tests/
uv run pytest -m integration tests/

# Run parallel
uv run pytest -n auto tests/

# Run with profiling
uv run pytest --profile tests/
```

### Test Analysis
```bash
# Find slow tests
uv run pytest --durations=10 tests/

# List all tests
uv run pytest --collect-only tests/

# Run specific test pattern
uv run pytest -k "test_audio" tests/

# Verbose failure output
uv run pytest -vvs tests/
```

## Test Quality Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- Overall: 80% minimum
- Critical paths: 95% minimum
- API endpoints: 100%
- Error handling: 90%
- Database operations: 85%
- Business logic: 90%

### Performance Targets
- Unit tests: <100ms each
- Integration tests: <1s each
- Full suite: <5 minutes
- CI pipeline: <10 minutes

### Reliability Targets
- Zero flaky tests
- 100% reproducible failures
- No test interdependencies
- Full isolation between tests

## Common Test Issues to Fix

### Async Test Issues
```python
# Bad: Missing async handling
def test_async_function():
    result = async_function()  # Will fail

# Good: Proper async test
async def test_async_function():
    result = await async_function()
```

### Mock Issues
```python
# Bad: Incorrect mock path
@patch('module.function')

# Good: Mock where it's used
@patch('services.service.module.function')
```

### Fixture Issues
```python
# Bad: Shared mutable fixtures
@pytest.fixture
def data():
    return []  # Shared between tests

# Good: Factory fixture
@pytest.fixture
def data():
    return lambda: []  # New instance each time
```

## Dependencies
- pytest and plugins must be installed
- Test database must be available
- Mock data must be generated
- All service dependencies configured
