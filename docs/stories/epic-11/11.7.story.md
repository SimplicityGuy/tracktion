# Story 11.7: Remove S3 Support - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **development team**,
I want **all S3/AWS storage support removed from the tracklist service**,
So that **the system maintains a clean, focused storage architecture without unnecessary cloud dependencies**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Tracklist Service storage layer
- Technology: Python, storage abstraction pattern
- Follows pattern: Service-based storage abstraction with pluggable backends
- Touch points: `/services/tracklist_service/src/services/storage_service.py`

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Remove all S3/boto3/AWS references from storage_service.py
2. Remove any S3-related configuration options or environment variables
3. Ensure storage service maintains existing non-S3 functionality

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing local/file storage functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New storage implementation follows existing storage abstraction pattern
6. Integration with tracklist generation maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests
8. Documentation is updated to reflect S3 removal
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Remove S3-specific code while preserving storage abstraction interface
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Service-based storage abstraction in `storage_service.py`
- **Key Constraints:** Must not break existing tracklist generation workflows

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking storage abstraction interface
- **Mitigation:** Preserve existing method signatures and behavior
- **Rollback:** Git revert of S3 removal changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Storage interface remains consistent
- [ ] No impact on tracklist generation workflows
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Story Validation

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [ ] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple

## Story Priority: Medium
**Rationale:** S3 support was never part of original PRD and should be removed to maintain clean architecture.

## Estimated Effort: 2-4 hours
- Code removal and cleanup: 1-2 hours
- Testing and validation: 1 hour
- Documentation updates: 1 hour

## Dependencies: None
- Independent story with no external dependencies
- Can be completed alongside other Epic 11 stories

**Epic:** Epic 11 - Technical Debt Cleanup
**Context:** Brownfield enhancement to remove unused S3 support from tracklist service
