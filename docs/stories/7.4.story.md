## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher: `services/file_watcher/`
- Docker compose: `infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml`
- RabbitMQ config: `infrastructure/rabbitmq/definitions.json`

#### Multi-Instance Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- Multiple instances monitoring different directories
- No conflicts in message queue
- No database conflicts
- Clear instance identification in logs

#### Implementation Approach

##### Instance ID Generation
```python
import uuid
import os

# Generate unique instance ID
instance_id = os.environ.get('INSTANCE_ID') or str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]
watched_dir = os.environ.get('DATA_DIR', '/data/music')

# Include in logging
logging.basicConfig(
    format=f'%(asctime)s - [{instance_id}:{watched_dir}] - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
```

##### RabbitMQ Configuration
```python
# Unique connection name
connection_params = pika.ConnectionParameters(
    host='rabbitmq',
    client_properties={'connection_name': f'file_watcher_{instance_id}'}
)

# Add instance metadata to messages
message = {
    'instance_id': instance_id,
    'watched_directory': watched_dir,
    'event_type': 'file_created',
    'file_path': file_path,
    'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}
```

##### Docker Compose Multi-Instance
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  file_watcher_1:
    build: ./services/file_watcher
    environment:
      - INSTANCE_ID=watcher1
      - DATA_DIR=/data/music
    volumes:
      - /host/music:/data/music

  file_watcher_2:
    build: ./services/file_watcher
    environment:
      - INSTANCE_ID=watcher2
      - DATA_DIR=/data/downloads
    volumes:
      - /host/downloads:/data/downloads

  file_watcher_3:
    build: ./services/file_watcher
    environment:
      - INSTANCE_ID=watcher3
      - DATA_DIR=/data/imports
    volumes:
      - /host/imports:/data/imports
```

#### Database Conflict Prevention
- Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT for upserts
- Proper transaction isolation levels
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Unique constraints on file paths/hashes

#### Testing Scenarios
1. Simultaneous file creation in different directories
2. Same file copied to multiple watched directories
3. High volume of events across instances
4. Instance failure and recovery
5. Database connection pool limits

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Integration tests with multiple containers
- Stress testing required
- Monitor for race conditions
- Document test scenarios

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Proper error handling
- Clear logging with context
- Thread-safe operations
- Resource cleanup on shutdown

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of multi-instance support. The code demonstrates strong engineering practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and thoughtful design decisions. The instance identification system is robust and well-integrated throughout the service.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed. The implementation is clean and follows best practices:
- Instance ID generation with fallback mechanism is elegant
- Custom structlog processor for instance ID injection is properly implemented
- RabbitMQ connection metadata is well-structured
- Message enrichment with instance metadata is consistent

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Type hints present, proper error handling, clean code structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Files appropriately placed in service and test directories
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage of multi-instance scenarios
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Testing Validation

- Unit Tests: 14 tests created, covering instance identification, message publishing, and multi-instance scenarios
- Test Coverage: Adequate coverage for new functionality
- Test Quality: Tests are well-structured with proper mocking and isolation
- Edge Cases: Tests include environment variable handling, auto-generation fallback, and concurrent publishers

### Improvements Checklist

#### Strengths Observed:
1. **Clean Architecture**: Instance ID is properly abstracted and injected through dependency injection
2. **Robust Fallback**: UUID generation when INSTANCE_ID not provided ensures uniqueness
3. **Observability**: Instance metadata in logs and RabbitMQ connections aids debugging
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive operational documentation with troubleshooting guide
5. **Testing**: Good test coverage including edge cases and concurrent scenarios

#### Minor Suggestions (Non-Critical):
1. Consider adding instance health metrics for monitoring dashboards
2. Could benefit from integration tests using docker-compose.multi-instance.yaml
3. Stress test script could include metrics output for CI/CD integration

### Security Review

Security implementation is appropriate:
- No hardcoded credentials, all configuration via environment variables
- Read-only volume mounts in Docker configuration
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Instance IDs don't expose sensitive information

### Performance Considerations

Performance impact is minimal:
- Instance ID generation happens once at startup
- Log processor adds negligible overhead
- RabbitMQ connection metadata doesn't affect throughput
- Multi-instance design scales horizontally as intended

### Technical Excellence Notes

**Outstanding Implementation Aspects:**
1. **Instance Identification**: Clean implementation with environment variable override capability
2. **Logging Integration**: Structlog processor pattern is the correct approach
3. **RabbitMQ Visibility**: Connection naming in management console aids operations
4. **Docker Configuration**: Well-structured multi-instance compose file with profiles
5. **Documentation Quality**: Operational guide covers deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting comprehensively
6. **Test Strategy**: Unit tests properly validate instance isolation and concurrent operation

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

Exceptional implementation of multi-instance support. The solution is production-ready with proper instance identification, message queue integration, comprehensive testing, and excellent documentation. All acceptance criteria are met with high-quality code that follows best practices.
