# Story 3.1: Ogg Vorbis File Detection

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 3 - Missing File Format (Ogg Vorbis Support)
- **Story Number**: 3.1
- **Status**: Development Complete
- **Created**: 2025-08-21
- **Updated**: 2025-08-21

## Story Statement
**As a** DJ with Ogg Vorbis files in my library,
**I want** the system to automatically detect and catalog my .ogg files,
**So that** my entire music collection is properly indexed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System detects files with .ogg, .oga extensions
2. File watcher triggers on Ogg Vorbis files
3. Files are added to processing queue
4. Invalid/corrupted files are logged appropriately

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**:
- Story 2.6 established comprehensive pipeline optimization with monitoring capabilities
- Existing metadata extraction service already uses mutagen library which has OGG support available
- File watcher service structure is in place but needs extension for new formats
- Analysis service has modular format handlers that can be extended
[Source: Story 2.6 Dev Agent Record]

**Technical Stack**:
- **Python**: 3.13 (latest stable)
- **Metadata Library**: mutagen (already in use, supports OGG/Vorbis)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ 4.0 for event-driven communication
- **Logging**: Structured logging with JSON format already implemented
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Current File Format Support**:
- Currently supported formats: .mp3, .flac, .wav, .wave, .m4a, .mp4, .m4b, .m4p, .m4v, .m4r
- Metadata extraction implemented in: services/analysis_service/src/metadata_extractor.py
- Format handlers use dictionary mapping: extension → handler function
- SUPPORTED_FORMATS set defined in MetadataExtractor class
[Source: services/analysis_service/src/metadata_extractor.py]

**File Locations**:
- File Watcher Service: services/file_watcher/src/
- Analysis Service metadata: services/analysis_service/src/metadata_extractor.py
- Unit tests: tests/unit/file_watcher/ and tests/unit/analysis_service/
- Integration tests: tests/integration/
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Message Queue Integration**:
- File watcher publishes file discovery events to RabbitMQ
- Analysis service consumes messages for processing
- Event-driven pattern with correlation IDs for tracing
- Messages should include file path, type, and discovery timestamp
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Error Handling Requirements**:
- Invalid/corrupted files must be logged with structured logging
- Use correlation IDs for message tracing
- Implement graceful error handling without crashing service
- Log file path, error type, and timestamp for failed files
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Framework**: pytest with `uv run pytest` execution
- **Test Location**: tests/unit/file_watcher/ for file detection tests
- **Test Location**: tests/unit/analysis_service/ for metadata extraction tests
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Pre-commit**: Must pass all hooks before commit (ruff, mypy, etc.)
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Library Notes**:
- mutagen library already supports OGG Vorbis through mutagen.oggvorbis module
- No additional dependencies needed for basic OGG support
- pyogg may be needed later for audio decoding in Story 3.3

## Project Structure Notes
This story extends the existing file detection and metadata extraction capabilities to support OGG Vorbis format. The implementation should follow the established patterns in the metadata_extractor.py module, using the existing format handler dictionary approach. No new services or major architectural changes are required - this is an incremental enhancement to existing functionality.
