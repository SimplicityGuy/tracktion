## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Depends on Story 9.2 - requires tokenization system to generate features for ML model.

### Data Models
ML Model Storage:
```python
class MLModel:
    id: str
    version: str
    algorithm: str  # random_forest, lstm
    created_at: datetime
    training_metrics: dict
    hyperparameters: dict
    feature_config: dict
    status: str  # training, deployed, archived
    file_path: str  # path to serialized model

class TrainingData:
    filename_original: str
    filename_renamed: str
    tokens: List[Token]
    user_approved: bool
    confidence_score: float
```

### API Specifications
ML Model endpoints:
- POST `/model/train` - Start training job
- GET `/model/status/{job_id}` - Check training status
- POST `/model/predict` - Get predictions
- POST `/model/feedback` - Submit feedback
- GET `/model/metrics` - Get performance metrics

### Component Specifications
Not applicable - backend ML processing only

### File Locations
- ML models: `services/file_rename_service/app/ml/`
- Model training: `services/file_rename_service/app/ml/trainer.py`
- Model inference: `services/file_rename_service/app/ml/predictor.py`
- Feature engineering: `services/file_rename_service/app/ml/features.py`
- Model storage: `services/file_rename_service/models/` (file system)
- Tests: `tests/unit/file_rename_service/test_ml_model.py`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test model training with synthetic data
- Validate prediction accuracy
- Test model versioning and rollback
- Performance benchmarks for training and inference
- Mock file system operations for model storage

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use scikit-learn for Random Forest
- Optional: TensorFlow/PyTorch for LSTM
- Store models in file system with metadata in PostgreSQL
- Use Redis for caching predictions
- Implement async training with Celery or similar

### ML-Specific Requirements
- Model interpretability: Provide feature importance
- Monitoring: Track model drift over time
- Reproducibility: Set random seeds, log hyperparameters
- Scalability: Support incremental learning

## Testing
- Test location: `tests/unit/file_rename_service/test_ml_model.py`
- Accuracy requirement: >70% on validation set
- Training time: <5 minutes for 10K samples
- Inference time: <50ms per prediction
- Use pytest-benchmark for performance tests
- Create fixtures for training data
