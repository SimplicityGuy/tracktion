## Dev Notes

### Dependencies
**Story 5.1 Must Be Complete**: The CUE parser from Story 5.1 is required for loading and analyzing CUE files.

### Relevant Architecture Information

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Testing**: pytest framework
- **Code Standards**: ruff for linting, mypy for type checking

#### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The CUE validator will extend the analysis_service CUE handler:
- Location: `services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/validator.py`
- Rules: `services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/validation_rules.py`
- Audio: `services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/audio_analyzer.py`
- Tests: `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/test_validator.py`

#### CUE Validation Specifications
[Source: docs/prd/epic-5-cue-file-handler.md#L74-153]

**Critical Validation Rules**:

1. **Command Structure**:
   - FILE must include filename and format type
   - TRACK must have number (01-99) and type (AUDIO, etc.)
   - INDEX must have number (00-99) and time (MM:SS:FF)

2. **Command Order** (MUST validate):
   ```
   CATALOG (optional, but must be first if present)
   CDTEXTFILE (optional)
   TITLE (disc-level, optional)
   PERFORMER (disc-level, optional)
   REM (disc-level, optional, multiple allowed)
   FILE (required)
     TRACK (required, 01-99)
       FLAGS (optional)
       TITLE (track-level, optional)
       PERFORMER (track-level, optional)
       SONGWRITER (optional)
       ISRC (optional)
       REM (track-level, optional, multiple allowed)
       PREGAP (optional)
       INDEX 00 (optional, pregap start)
       INDEX 01 (required, track start)
       INDEX 02-99 (optional, subdivisions)
       POSTGAP (optional)
   ```

3. **Time Validation**:
   - Format: MM:SS:FF where FF is 0-74 (75 frames/second)
   - Times must be cumulative from file start
   - No overlapping track times
   - INDEX 00 < INDEX 01 when both present
   - Total time should not exceed audio file duration

4. **Format Constraints**:
   - CATALOG: 13 digits only (UPC/EAN)
   - ISRC: 12 characters (country[2] + registrant[3] + year[2] + code[5])
   - TITLE/PERFORMER: Maximum 80 characters (CD-Text limit)
   - FLAGS: Only DCP, 4CH, PRE, SCMS allowed

5. **File Validation**:
   - Referenced files must exist and be readable
   - File format must match declaration (WAVE for .wav, MP3 for .mp3)
   - FLAC files typically use WAVE type for compatibility

### Validation Severity Levels
```python
class Severity(Enum):
    ERROR = "error"      # Prevents CUE from working
    WARNING = "warning"  # May cause issues in some software
    INFO = "info"        # Suggestions for improvement

# Examples:
ERROR: Missing required INDEX 01
ERROR: Referenced audio file not found
ERROR: Invalid time format
WARNING: TITLE exceeds 80 character limit
WARNING: Non-standard REM field detected
INFO: Consider adding ISRC for track identification
```

### Audio Duration Analysis
```python
def analyze_audio_duration(file_path: str) -> float:
    """Get audio file duration in milliseconds.

    Uses mutagen for metadata extraction, falls back to pydub
    for direct audio analysis if needed.
    """
    from mutagen import File
    from pydub import AudioSegment

    try:
        # Try mutagen first (faster)
        audio = File(file_path)
        if audio and audio.info:
            return audio.info.length * 1000  # Convert to ms
    except:
        pass

    try:
        # Fall back to pydub (more formats)
        audio = AudioSegment.from_file(file_path)
        return len(audio)  # Already in ms
    except:
        return 0  # Cannot determine duration
```

### Validation Report Structure
```python
@dataclass
class ValidationIssue:
    severity: Severity
    line_number: Optional[int]
    category: str  # "syntax", "timing", "file", "format", etc.
    message: str
    suggestion: Optional[str]

@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    file_path: str
    is_valid: bool  # True if no ERRORS
    errors: List[ValidationIssue]
    warnings: List[ValidationIssue]
    info: List[ValidationIssue]
    audio_duration_ms: Optional[float]
    cue_duration_ms: Optional[float]
    format_compatibility: Dict[str, bool]  # {"CDJ": True, "Traktor": False, ...}

    def to_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate human-readable report."""
        pass

    def to_json(self) -> dict:
        """Generate JSON report for programmatic use."""
        pass
```

### Common Issues and Auto-Fix Suggestions
1. **Missing INDEX 01**: Add INDEX 01 at track start
2. **Time overlap**: Adjust subsequent track times
3. **Exceeds audio duration**: Trim last track time
4. **Character limit exceeded**: Truncate with "..."
5. **Wrong file path**: Suggest relative path from CUE location
6. **Invalid ISRC**: Format as XX-XXX-YY-NNNNN
7. **Track gap**: Suggest INDEX 00 for pregap

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest with `uv run pytest` execution
- **Test Files**: `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/test_validator.py`
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Test Data**: Create sample CUE files with various issues for testing

### Code Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **MANDATORY**: Use `uv run python` instead of `python` or `python3`
- **MANDATORY**: Use `uv run pytest` for running tests
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Must pass before committing
- **Type hints**: Required with mypy validation

### Integration with Existing Models
[Source: shared/core_types/src/models.py#L104-139]
The validator can be used to:
1. Validate CUE files before saving to Tracklist.cue_file_path
2. Ensure Tracklist.tracks JSONB matches CUE content
3. Validate against Recording file_path and duration

### Example Usage
```python
from cue_handler import CueValidator

# Validate a single CUE file
validator = CueValidator()
result = validator.validate("mix.cue")

if not result.is_valid:
    print(f"Validation failed with {len(result.errors)} errors")
    for error in result.errors:
        print(f"Line {error.line_number}: {error.message}")
        if error.suggestion:
            print(f"  Suggestion: {error.suggestion}")
else:
    print("CUE file is valid!")
    if result.warnings:
        print(f"Found {len(result.warnings)} warnings")

# Generate report
report = result.to_report()
print(report)
```

#### Test Coverage (Score: 7/10)
✅ **Current Coverage:**
- `validator.py`: 86% coverage
- `validation_rules.py`: 70% coverage
- All tests passing (14/14)

⚠️ **Coverage Gaps Identified:**
- Audio analyzer fallback paths not fully tested
- Some error handling branches in validator untested
- File permission error cases need more coverage

### Security Review

✅ **No Critical Issues Found**
- Proper path validation prevents directory traversal
- Safe file operations with appropriate error handling
- No use of eval() or exec()
- Input validation on all user-provided paths

⚠️ **Minor Recommendations:**
1. Consider adding file size limits for audio analysis
2. Implement timeout for audio file processing
3. Add rate limiting for batch validation operations

### Performance Analysis

✅ **Efficient Design:**
- Lazy loading of audio analysis libraries
- Single-pass validation where possible
- Proper use of generators for batch operations

⚠️ **Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Cache audio duration results for repeated validations
2. Consider parallel processing for batch validation
3. Optimize regex compilation for repeated use

### Functional Testing Results

✅ **All Core Features Working:**
1. ✅ Syntax validation correctly identifies all specified errors
2. ✅ File reference validation with proper path resolution
3. ✅ Timestamp validation with frame accuracy
4. ✅ Audio duration comparison functioning
5. ✅ Compatibility checks for all specified formats
6. ✅ Report generation in both text and JSON formats
7. ✅ Auto-fix suggestions generated appropriately

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

✅ **Well-Handled Cases:**
- Non-existent CUE files
- Missing audio files
- Parse errors
- Permission denied scenarios
- Multi-file CUEs

⚠️ **Additional Edge Cases to Consider:**
1. Extremely large CUE files (>1000 tracks)
2. Circular file references
3. Symbolic links in file paths
4. Network-mounted audio files
5. Corrupted audio files

### Recommendations for Enhancement

2. **Implement Fix Application**: Add method to apply auto-fix suggestions automatically
3. **Add Streaming Validation**: Support validation without loading entire file into memory

#### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Metrics**: Add timing information to validation reports
2. **Validation Caching**: Cache validation results with file hash checking
3. **Custom Rule Support**: Allow users to define custom validation rules via configuration

#### Low Priority
1. **Visual Report Generation**: HTML report output with charts
2. **Integration with Audio Workstations**: Direct integration with DAW software
3. **Batch Report Aggregation**: Combine multiple validation reports into summary

### Code Refactoring Suggestions

```python
# Suggested improvement for ValidationResult class
class ValidationResult:
    """Enhanced with builder pattern and caching."""

    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.is_valid = True
        self._issues_by_severity = defaultdict(list)
        self._report_cache = None

    @property
    def errors(self):
        return self._issues_by_severity[Severity.ERROR]

    def to_report(self) -> str:
        if self._report_cache is None:
            self._report_cache = self._generate_report()
        return self._report_cache
```

### Testing Recommendations

```python
# Additional test cases to implement
def test_large_cue_file_performance():
    """Test validation performance with 1000+ tracks."""
    pass

def test_circular_reference_detection():
    """Test handling of circular file references."""
    pass

def test_concurrent_batch_validation():
    """Test thread safety of batch validation."""
    pass
```

### Documentation Quality
✅ **Excellent Documentation:**
- Clear docstrings on all public methods
- Good inline comments for complex logic
