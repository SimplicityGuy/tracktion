- **Story 5.2**: CUE generator for saving files
Both stories must be complete before starting this story.

### Relevant Architecture Information

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Testing**: pytest framework
- **Code Standards**: ruff for linting, mypy for type checking

#### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The CUE editor will extend the analysis_service CUE handler:
- Location: `services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/editor.py`
- Backup: `services/analysis_service/src/cue_handler/backup.py`
- Tests: `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/test_editor.py`

#### Existing Components from Previous Stories
[Source: Story 5.1]
- CueSheet model class for representing parsed CUE data
- Track model class with all attributes
- CueTime class for frame-accurate timestamps
- Parser exceptions for error handling

[Source: Story 5.2]
- CueGenerator class for creating CUE files
- Format variants (standard, CDJ, Traktor, Serato, Rekordbox, Kodi)
- Time calculation utilities
- Command ordering logic

#### CUE Editing Specifications
[Source: docs/prd/epic-5-cue-file-handler.md#L62-73]

**Editor Requirements**:
- In-place editing capabilities
- Track addition/removal/reordering
- INDEX adjustment (including INDEX 00 for pregaps)
- Metadata updates (TITLE, PERFORMER, SONGWRITER)
- ISRC and CATALOG code management
- Format conversion between CUE variants
- Multi-file CUE sheet handling

**Critical Validation Rules**:
1. Track numbers must be sequential (01-99)
2. INDEX times must be cumulative and non-overlapping
3. INDEX 01 is required for each track
4. INDEX 00 must come before INDEX 01 if present
5. Character limits: 80 chars for TITLE/PERFORMER
6. ISRC must be 12 characters
7. CATALOG must be 13 digits (UPC/EAN)

### Timestamp Adjustment Algorithm
```python
def adjust_track_time(track_index: int, new_time: CueTime, ripple: bool = True):
    """Adjust track timestamp with optional ripple effect.

    Args:
        track_index: Track number to adjust (1-based)
        new_time: New INDEX 01 time for the track
        ripple: If True, adjust all subsequent tracks by the same delta
    """
    old_time = tracks[track_index - 1].index_01
    delta = new_time.to_frames() - old_time.to_frames()

    tracks[track_index - 1].index_01 = new_time

    if ripple and delta != 0:
        for i in range(track_index, len(tracks)):
            for index in tracks[i].indices:
                old_frames = index.time.to_frames()
                new_frames = old_frames + delta
                index.time = CueTime.from_frames(new_frames)
```

### Backup Naming Convention
```
original.cue          # Original file
original.cue.bak      # First backup (most recent)
original.cue.bak.1    # Second backup
original.cue.bak.2    # Third backup
...
original.cue.bak.N    # Oldest backup (N = retention_limit)
```

### Format Detection Strategy
1. Check for format-specific REM comments (e.g., "REM GENERATOR Traktor")
2. Analyze command usage patterns (e.g., CDJ-specific FLAGS)
3. Check for proprietary extensions
4. Default to standard format if uncertain
5. Preserve detected format during save unless explicitly converted

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest with `uv run pytest` execution
- **Test Files**: `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_cue_handler/test_editor.py`
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Integration Testing**: Test with parser and generator components
- **Edge Cases**: Test all validation rules and error conditions

### Code Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **MANDATORY**: Use `uv run python` instead of `python` or `python3`
- **MANDATORY**: Use `uv run pytest` for running tests
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Must pass before committing
- **Type hints**: Required with mypy validation

### Example Usage
```python
from cue_handler import CueEditor

# Load and edit a CUE file
editor = CueEditor()
editor.load_cue_file("mix.cue")

# Add a new track
editor.add_track(
    title="New Track",
    performer="Artist",
    start_time="15:30:00"
)

# Adjust timing with ripple effect
editor.adjust_track_time(3, "10:15:30", ripple=True)

# Update metadata
editor.update_track_metadata(2, title="Updated Title")

# Save with backup
editor.save_cue_file("mix.cue", create_backup=True)
```

### Integration with Tracklist Model
[Source: shared/core_types/src/models.py#L104-139]
The editor should be able to:
1. Load tracks from Tracklist.tracks JSONB
2. Update Tracklist.cue_file_path after saving
3. Sync changes back to Tracklist.tracks
4. Validate against Recording duration if available
