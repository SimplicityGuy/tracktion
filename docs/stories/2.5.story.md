# Story 2.5: File Rename Proposal Service

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 2 - Metadata Analysis & Naming
- **Story Number**: 2.5
- **Status**: Ready for Review
- **Created**: 2025-08-19
- **Updated**: 2025-08-19

## Story Statement
**As a** music collector,
**I want** a service that proposes new filenames based on extracted metadata and configurable patterns,
**so that** I can review and approve consistent, meaningful names for my music files before any actual renaming occurs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new file_rename_proposal_service is created as a separate microservice or module within analysis_service.
2. The service generates filename proposals using configurable naming patterns with template syntax (e.g., "{artist} - {title} - {bpm}BPM").
3. Proposed filenames are validated for filesystem compatibility (removes invalid characters, handles length limits).
4. Each proposal includes:
   - Original filename and path
   - Proposed new filename
   - Confidence score based on metadata completeness
   - Potential conflicts or warnings
   - Preview of the full path with new name
5. Proposals are stored in the database with status tracking (pending, approved, rejected, applied).
6. The service detects and flags potential naming conflicts before any renaming occurs.
7. Different naming patterns can be configured based on file type or metadata conditions.
8. A batch proposal generation mode can process multiple files and store all proposals for later review.
9. The service exposes an API/message interface to retrieve pending proposals for UI consumption.
10. **NO actual file renaming occurs** - this service only generates and stores proposals.
11. Unit tests cover various naming patterns, edge cases, and conflict detection.

[Source: Story 2.4 Dev Agent Record]

### Data Models
**Metadata Model** (for reading existing metadata):
- `id`: UUID
- `recording_id`: Foreign key to Recording
- `key`: String (e.g., "artist", "title", "bpm", "key", "mood")
- `value`: String containing the metadata value
[Source: architecture/data-models-refined-and-finalized.md#metadata]

**Recording Model** (for referencing files):
- `id`: UUID
- `file_path`: Full path to file
- `file_name`: Current filename
[Source: architecture/data-models-refined-and-finalized.md#recording]

### File Locations
Based on project structure, new code should be created at:
- Main module: `services/analysis_service/src/file_rename_proposal/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/analysis_service/test_file_rename_proposal/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_rename_proposal_integration.py`
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.13 (per tech stack, though note Story 2.3 found 3.12 works better with Essentia)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ 4.0 for inter-service communication
- **No Direct File Operations**: This service must NOT perform any actual file renaming
- **Pattern Syntax**: Use Python string.format() style templates for flexibility
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Requirements
- **Framework**: pytest with `uv run pytest` command
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Test Location**: `tests/unit/analysis_service/` for unit tests
- **Pre-commit**: Must pass all hooks including ruff, mypy, formatting
- **Execution Pattern**:
  - Unit tests after each task: `uv run pytest tests/unit/analysis_service/test_file_rename_proposal/ -v`
  - Integration tests when available: `uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v`
  - Pre-commit before commits: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Configuration Management
Following the pattern from previous stories:
- Use configuration classes with dependency injection
- Support environment variables for sensitive configs
- Provide sensible defaults for development
- Document all configuration options
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#configuration]

## Project Structure Notes
This story creates a new module within the analysis_service, following the established pattern from Stories 2.3 and 2.4. The file_rename_proposal module will sit alongside the existing bpm_detector, key_detector, and mood_analyzer modules. It should follow the same architectural patterns: dependency injection, configuration management, comprehensive error handling, and integration with the existing message consumer infrastructure. The key difference is this service only generates proposals - it never performs actual file operations.
