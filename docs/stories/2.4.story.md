# Story 2.4: Musical Key and Mood Detection

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 2 - Metadata Analysis & Naming
- **Story Number**: 2.4
- **Status**: Complete
- **Created**: 2025-08-19
- **Updated**: 2025-08-19
- **Completed**: 2025-08-19

## Story Statement
**As a** music curator,
**I want** automatic detection of musical key and mood characteristics,
**so that** I can create harmonically compatible playlists and understand the emotional content of my music.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Musical key detection is implemented using appropriate audio analysis library (essentia preferred).
2. Key detection provides both the root note and scale type (major/minor) with confidence scores.
3. Advanced mood analysis is implemented using Essentia's pre-trained TensorFlow models providing:
   - Multiple mood dimensions (acoustic, electronic, aggressive, relaxed, happy, sad, party)
   - Danceability scores
   - Additional attributes (gender, tonality, voice/instrumental classification)
   - Genre classification using Discogs EffNet models
4. Confidence scores are provided for all predictions using ensemble model approach.
5. All detected features are stored as metadata in both databases with appropriate relationships in Neo4j.
6. The analysis pipeline can process multiple features in parallel for efficiency.
7. Results are validated against a test set of tracks with known keys (accuracy >80%).
8. Integration with existing metadata extraction ensures all analysis happens in a single pass when possible.
9. API endpoint or message format is defined for querying analysis results.

### Implementation Code Patterns

#### Key Detection (from Research)
```python
def detect_key_with_validation(audio_path):
    """Production-ready key detection"""
    audio = es.MonoLoader(filename=audio_path)()

    # Primary detection
    key, scale, strength = es.KeyExtractor()(audio)

    # Validation with alternative algorithm
    hpcp = es.HPCP()(es.Spectrum()(audio))
    key_alt, scale_alt, _, _ = es.Key()(hpcp)

    # Agreement check
    agreement = (key == key_alt) and (scale == scale_alt)
    confidence = strength * (1.2 if agreement else 0.8)

    return {
        'key': key,
        'scale': scale,
        'confidence': min(confidence, 1.0),
        'needs_review': confidence < 0.7
    }
```

#### Mood/Genre Classification (from Research)
```python
def classify_with_ensemble(audio_path):
    """Ensemble classification for improved accuracy"""
    audio = es.MonoLoader(filename=audio_path, sampleRate=16000)()

    # Load multiple models (cached)
    models = load_cached_models(['genre_discogs', 'genre_electronic'])

    # Ensemble voting
    predictions = []
    for model in models:
        pred = model.predict(audio)
        predictions.append(pred)

    # Weighted voting based on model confidence
    final_genre = weighted_vote(predictions)
    confidence = calculate_ensemble_confidence(predictions)

    return {
        'genre': final_genre,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'all_predictions': predictions
    }
```

## Project Structure Notes
Following the established pattern from Story 2.3, this story will add new detection modules alongside the existing BPM detector. The model_manager will be a new component responsible for handling the large TensorFlow models required for mood and genre classification. All new modules should follow the same architectural patterns established in Story 2.3 (dependency injection, configuration management, comprehensive error handling).
