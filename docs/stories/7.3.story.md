# Story 7.3: Implement Dual Hashing (SHA256 + XXH128)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system processing large files,
**I want** both SHA256 and fast XXH128 hashing,
**so that** I have cryptographic integrity AND efficient duplicate detection

## Acceptance Criteria
1. xxhash Python library is properly integrated
2. Both SHA256 and XXH128 hashes are calculated correctly
3. Database stores both hash values
4. Performance impact is acceptable
5. Both hashes are used appropriately

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Add xxhash library dependency (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add xxhash to pyproject.toml dependencies
  - [ ] Update requirements if separate file exists
  - [ ] Verify library installation in Docker image
  - [ ] Document version requirements

- [ ] Task 2: Implement dual-hashing system (AC: 2,5)
  - [ ] Keep existing SHA256 hash calculations
  - [ ] Add XXH128 hash function utility alongside SHA256
  - [ ] Create combined hash calculation function
  - [ ] Ensure consistent hash format (hex strings)

- [ ] Task 3: Update database operations (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify both hash columns exist (sha256_hash, xxh128_hash)
  - [ ] Update insert/update queries to include both hashes
  - [ ] Ensure both hashes are populated for all files
  - [ ] Update model definitions to include both fields

- [ ] Task 4: Implement efficient dual-hash calculation (AC: 2,4)
  - [ ] Create single-pass file reading for both hashes
  - [ ] Implement chunked reading to avoid memory issues
  - [ ] Calculate both hashes incrementally in parallel
  - [ ] Return both hashes in consistent format

- [ ] Task 5: Define hash usage strategy (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Use XXH128 for quick duplicate detection
  - [ ] Use SHA256 for data integrity verification
  - [ ] Document when to use each hash type
  - [ ] Implement appropriate hash selection logic

- [ ] Task 6: Performance benchmarking (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create benchmark script for dual-hash performance
  - [ ] Test with various file sizes (1MB, 100MB, 1GB)
  - [ ] Measure overhead of calculating both hashes
  - [ ] Document performance characteristics

- [ ] Task 7: Write comprehensive tests (AC: All)
  - [ ] Unit tests for dual-hash calculation
  - [ ] Test both SHA256 and XXH128 with known values
  - [ ] Test chunked reading for large files
  - [ ] Integration tests with database storage
  - [ ] Verify both hashes are stored correctly

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher service: `services/file_watcher/src/`
- Database models: May be in `shared/core_types/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/file_watcher/`

#### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]
Current schema includes:
- `sha256_hash VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE`
- `xxh128_hash VARCHAR(32) UNIQUE`

Note: Schema already has xxh128_hash column, need to verify it's being used.

#### Technical Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD - Modified]
- Must use xxhash Python library for XXH128
- Keep SHA256 for cryptographic integrity
- Calculate BOTH hashes for every file
- Store both values in database
- Use appropriately based on need

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
import hashlib
import xxhash
from typing import Tuple

def calculate_dual_hashes(file_path: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Calculate both SHA256 and XXH128 hashes for a file."""
    sha256_hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    xxh128_hasher = xxhash.xxh128()

    # Single pass through file for both hashes
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while chunk := f.read(8192):  # 8KB chunks
            sha256_hasher.update(chunk)
            xxh128_hasher.update(chunk)

    return sha256_hasher.hexdigest(), xxh128_hasher.hexdigest()

# Usage
sha256_hash, xxh128_hash = calculate_dual_hashes('/path/to/file.mp3')
# sha256: 64-character hex string
# xxh128: 32-character hex string
```

#### Hash Usage Strategy
- **XXH128**: Use for quick duplicate detection, file matching
- **SHA256**: Use for data integrity, verification, security
- **Database lookups**: Can use either based on performance needs
- **API responses**: Include both for flexibility

#### Performance Expectations
- XXH128 alone: 10-50x faster than SHA256
- Dual hashing: Slightly slower than SHA256 alone (negligible overhead)
- Benefits: Fast lookups with XXH128, integrity with SHA256
- Storage: Additional 32 chars per file (acceptable)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test files in `tests/unit/file_watcher/`
- Must achieve 80% code coverage
- Performance tests required
- Use `uv run pytest` for execution

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type hints for all functions
- Proper error handling
- Efficient memory usage for large files
- Clear documentation of hash format
