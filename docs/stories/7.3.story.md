## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher service: `services/file_watcher/src/`
- Database models: May be in `shared/core_types/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/file_watcher/`

#### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]
Current schema includes:
- `sha256_hash VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE`
- `xxh128_hash VARCHAR(32) UNIQUE`

Note: Schema already has xxh128_hash column, need to verify it's being used.

#### Technical Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD - Modified]
- Must use xxhash Python library for XXH128
- Keep SHA256 for cryptographic integrity
- Calculate BOTH hashes for every file
- Store both values in database
- Use appropriately based on need

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
import hashlib
import xxhash
from typing import Tuple

def calculate_dual_hashes(file_path: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Calculate both SHA256 and XXH128 hashes for a file."""
    sha256_hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    xxh128_hasher = xxhash.xxh128()

    # Single pass through file for both hashes
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while chunk := f.read(8192):  # 8KB chunks
            sha256_hasher.update(chunk)
            xxh128_hasher.update(chunk)

    return sha256_hasher.hexdigest(), xxh128_hasher.hexdigest()

# Usage
sha256_hash, xxh128_hash = calculate_dual_hashes('/path/to/file.mp3')
# sha256: 64-character hex string
# xxh128: 32-character hex string
```

#### Hash Usage Strategy
- **XXH128**: Use for quick duplicate detection, file matching
- **SHA256**: Use for data integrity, verification, security
- **Database lookups**: Can use either based on performance needs
- **API responses**: Include both for flexibility

#### Performance Expectations
- XXH128 alone: 10-50x faster than SHA256
- Dual hashing: Slightly slower than SHA256 alone (negligible overhead)
- Benefits: Fast lookups with XXH128, integrity with SHA256
- Storage: Additional 32 chars per file (acceptable)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test files in `tests/unit/file_watcher/`
- Must achieve 80% code coverage
- Performance tests required
- Use `uv run pytest` for execution

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type hints for all functions
- Proper error handling
- Efficient memory usage for large files
- Clear documentation of hash format

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of dual hashing functionality. The code follows clean architecture principles with good separation of concerns. The implementation efficiently calculates both hashes in a single file pass, properly handles errors with fallback mechanisms, and includes comprehensive test coverage. The strategy pattern used in `hash_utils.py` provides clear intent for hash selection based on use case.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed. The implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices:
- Single-pass file reading for efficiency
- Proper error handling with meaningful fallbacks
- Clear separation of hash calculation logic
- Well-documented code with proper type hints
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All type hints present, proper error handling, efficient memory usage
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in service and test directories
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with edge cases covered (16 tests)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

All implementation aspects are satisfactory. No improvements needed.

### Security Review

Security implementation is appropriate:
- Uses standard cryptographic library (hashlib) for SHA256
- No sensitive data logging
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Fallback hashing doesn't expose file contents

### Performance Considerations

Performance is excellent as documented:
- XXH128 is ~2.6x faster than SHA256 alone
- Dual hashing overhead is minimal (11-16%)
- Single-pass file reading maximizes I/O efficiency
- Chunked reading (8KB) prevents memory issues with large files
- Benchmark script validates performance claims

### Technical Excellence Notes

**Strengths observed:**
1. **Efficient Implementation**: Single-pass file reading with parallel hash calculation
2. **Clean Architecture**: Strategy pattern for hash selection is elegant and extensible
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when files can't be read
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests cover happy path, error cases, empty files, and large files
5. **Performance Validation**: Benchmark script provides concrete performance metrics
6. **Clear Documentation**: Code is well-documented with proper docstrings

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

Outstanding implementation that exceeds expectations. The dual hashing system is efficiently implemented with excellent test coverage and proper documentation. All acceptance criteria are met, and the code follows all project standards.
