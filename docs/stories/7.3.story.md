# Story 7.3: Implement Dual Hashing (SHA256 + XXH128)

## Status

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- File watcher service: `services/file_watcher/src/`
- Database models: May be in `shared/core_types/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/file_watcher/`

#### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema-refined-and-finalized.md]
Current schema includes:
- `sha256_hash VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE`
- `xxh128_hash VARCHAR(32) UNIQUE`

Note: Schema already has xxh128_hash column, need to verify it's being used.

#### Technical Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD - Modified]
- Must use xxhash Python library for XXH128
- Keep SHA256 for cryptographic integrity
- Calculate BOTH hashes for every file
- Store both values in database
- Use appropriately based on need

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
import hashlib
import xxhash
from typing import Tuple

def calculate_dual_hashes(file_path: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Calculate both SHA256 and XXH128 hashes for a file."""
    sha256_hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    xxh128_hasher = xxhash.xxh128()

    # Single pass through file for both hashes
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while chunk := f.read(8192):  # 8KB chunks
            sha256_hasher.update(chunk)
            xxh128_hasher.update(chunk)

    return sha256_hasher.hexdigest(), xxh128_hasher.hexdigest()

# Usage
sha256_hash, xxh128_hash = calculate_dual_hashes('/path/to/file.mp3')
# sha256: 64-character hex string
# xxh128: 32-character hex string
```

#### Hash Usage Strategy
- **XXH128**: Use for quick duplicate detection, file matching
- **SHA256**: Use for data integrity, verification, security
- **Database lookups**: Can use either based on performance needs
- **API responses**: Include both for flexibility

#### Performance Expectations
- XXH128 alone: 10-50x faster than SHA256
- Dual hashing: Slightly slower than SHA256 alone (negligible overhead)
- Benefits: Fast lookups with XXH128, integrity with SHA256
- Storage: Additional 32 chars per file (acceptable)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test files in `tests/unit/file_watcher/`
- Must achieve 80% code coverage
- Performance tests required
- Use `uv run pytest` for execution

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type hints for all functions
- Proper error handling
- Efficient memory usage for large files
- Clear documentation of hash format
