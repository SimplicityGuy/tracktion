### Relevant Architecture Context

#### Service Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- `services/analysis_service/` - Main service directory
- `services/analysis_service/src/` - Source code location
- `services/analysis_service/pyproject.toml` - Dependencies
- `tests/unit/analysis_service/` - Unit tests

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.13 for async/await support
- Redis 7.4 for caching analysis results
- RabbitMQ 4.0 for message queue
- Docker for containerization

#### Audio Analysis Components
[Source: Previous stories and PRD context]
- BPM detection algorithms (CPU-intensive)
- Key detection using FFT analysis
- Mood analysis using audio features
- Metadata extraction from audio files

#### Async Implementation Strategy
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- Use ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-bound operations
- AsyncIO for I/O-bound operations
- Maintain streaming responses for progress
- Resource limits based on available CPU cores
- Connection pooling for external services

#### Performance Targets
[Source: Epic 7 PRD]
- Process >100 concurrent audio files
- CPU utilization >70% during batch processing
- Memory usage <100MB per audio file
- Analysis completion <30s per file
- Progress updates every 1-2 seconds

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Thread Pool Configuration
- Default pool size: CPU count * 2
- Maximum pool size: CPU count * 4
- Use ProcessPoolExecutor for heavy CPU tasks
- ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O with CPU work

#### Progress Streaming Architecture
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Redis for progress state storage
- Event-driven progress notifications
- Batch progress aggregation

#### Resource Management
- Semaphore limit: CPU count * 2
- Memory monitoring with psutil
- Graceful degradation under load
- Task queue with priority levels

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test location: `tests/unit/analysis_service/`
- Use `uv run pytest` for execution
- Mock audio files for unit tests
- Test various audio formats (mp3, flac, wav)
- Performance benchmarks required
- Minimum 80% code coverage

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use `uv run` for all Python execution
- Type hints for all async functions
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Proper async context managers
- Environment variables for configuration

### Integration Points
- RabbitMQ for receiving analysis requests
- Redis for caching results
- PostgreSQL for storing metadata
- Neo4j for relationship mapping
- WebSocket for progress streaming
