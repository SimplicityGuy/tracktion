# Story 4.2: Retrieve Complete Tracklist

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 4 - Build 1001tracklists.com API
- **Story Number**: 4.2
- **Status**: Approved
- **Created**: 2025-08-21
- **Updated**: 2025-08-21

## Story Statement
**As a** user creating CUE files,
**I want** to retrieve complete tracklist data for a specific set,
**So that** I can generate accurate CUE files.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Full tracklist with all available tracks
2. Accurate timestamps for each track
3. Track metadata (artist, title, remix, label)
4. Handling of unknown/ID tracks
5. Mix transition information preserved

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**:
- Story 4.1 established the tracklist_service foundation with search functionality
- Base scraper class with anti-detection and rate limiting is already implemented
- Redis caching layer is functional for storing/retrieving scraped data
- Message queue integration via RabbitMQ is in place for async processing
- Resilience patterns (circuit breaker, exponential backoff) are implemented

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- **ScraperBase class**: Provides session management, rate limiting, user agent rotation
- **Redis Cache**: Available for storing complete tracklist data with TTL
- **Message Handler**: Can process tracklist retrieval requests asynchronously
- **Resilience Module**: Circuit breaker and retry logic ready to use
- **API Framework**: FastAPI endpoints can be extended for tracklist retrieval

**1001tracklists.com Tracklist Page Structure** (to be verified during implementation):
- **Track Information**: Usually in table/list format with track number, time, artist, title
- **Cue Points**: Timestamps typically in MM:SS or HH:MM:SS format
- **Track Metadata**: Artist name, track title, remix/edit info, label
- **ID Tracks**: Tracks marked as "ID" or "Unknown" need special handling
- **Transitions**: Mix transition points and types (if available)
- **Additional Info**: Guest mixes, track notes, download/stream links

**Data Model Requirements**:
- **Tracklist Model**: Main container for all tracklist data
- **Track Model**: Individual track with all metadata
- **CuePoint Model**: Timestamp information for CUE file generation
- **Transition Model**: Mix transition details between tracks
- **Metadata Flexibility**: Support for varying levels of track information

**Integration Points**:
- **Cataloging Service**: Store retrieved tracklist data in PostgreSQL
- **Analysis Service**: Cross-reference tracks with existing music library
- **CUE Generation**: Format data for CUE file creation (future story)
- **Message Queue**: Publish tracklist data for downstream processing

**Error Handling Scenarios**:
- **Page Not Found**: Graceful handling of 404 errors
- **Incomplete Data**: Partial extraction when some elements missing
- **Format Changes**: Detection and alerting for page structure changes
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect server limits and implement backoff
- **Parse Errors**: Log and report unparseable content

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Mock HTML responses for parser testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real 1001tracklists.com pages (with rate limiting)
- **Edge Cases**: Empty tracklists, ID-only sets, malformed timestamps
- **Performance**: Ensure parsing completes within reasonable time (<5s per tracklist)
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
