# Tracktion System Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Tracktion system architecture, including service interactions, data flow, and infrastructure components.

## System Overview

Tracktion is a distributed music analysis and management system built with a microservices architecture. The system processes audio files through multiple stages of analysis, cataloging, and organization.

### Core Principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate via message queues
- **Microservices Design**: Each service has a specific responsibility
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of processing services
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Caching, async processing, and optimization

## Service Architecture

### Core Services

#### 1. File Watcher Service
**Purpose**: Monitor file system for changes and trigger processing pipeline
- Monitors directories for audio file changes (create, modify, delete, rename)
- Supports 12+ audio formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, M4A, etc.)
- Generates file fingerprints using dual hashing (SHA256 + XXHash128)
- Publishes events to message queue for downstream processing
- Both synchronous and asynchronous implementations available

#### 2. Analysis Service
**Purpose**: Perform comprehensive audio analysis and metadata extraction
- **Audio Analysis**: BPM detection, musical key detection, mood analysis, genre classification
- **Metadata Extraction**: Title, artist, album, duration, bitrate, sample rate, format
- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: Uses multiple algorithms for accuracy validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel analysis, lazy model loading, Redis caching
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Neo4j for relationships

#### 3. Tracklist Service
**Purpose**: Provide search, discovery, and tracklist management capabilities
- **Web Scraping**: Extract tracklists from major DJ platforms (1001Tracklists, MixesDB)
- **Search Engine**: Fast search across tracks, artists, and tracklists
- **CUE Generation**: Create CUE sheets for DJ mixes with accurate timing
- **Caching**: Redis caching for search results and scraping data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects source website rate limits and ToS

#### 4. Cataloging Service
**Purpose**: Organize and manage the music catalog
- Consolidates file events and analysis results
- Maintains consistent catalog state across the system
- Handles deduplication and conflict resolution
- Provides catalog browsing and filtering capabilities

#### 5. File Rename Service
**Purpose**: Generate intelligent rename proposals based on metadata
- Analyzes metadata to suggest optimal file names
- Handles naming conflicts and validation
- Supports multiple naming patterns and conventions
- Integrates with user preferences and rules

#### 6. Notification Service
**Purpose**: Handle system notifications and alerts
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Discord webhooks, email, SMS (future)
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket and sliding window algorithms
- **Alert Types**: General, error, critical, tracklist, monitoring, security
- **Message History**: Redis-backed logging and analytics
- **Circuit Breaker**: Handles external service failures gracefully

### Support Infrastructure

#### Message Queue (RabbitMQ)
- **Primary Exchange**: `tracktion_exchange` (topic-based routing)
- **Dead Letter Handling**: Failed message processing and retry logic
- **High Availability**: Clustered configuration for production
- **Message Persistence**: Ensures no data loss during service restarts

#### Databases
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for structured data
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for complex relationships (artist connections, genre similarities)
- **Redis**: Caching layer and session storage

#### API Layer
- **FastAPI Framework**: High-performance async API endpoints
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **Rate Limiting**: API-level rate limiting and throttling
- **Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## Data Flow Architecture

### File Processing Pipeline
1. **File Detection**: File Watcher detects new/changed audio files
2. **Event Publishing**: File events published to message queue
3. **Analysis**: Analysis Service processes files for metadata and audio features
4. **Cataloging**: Cataloging Service updates the master catalog
5. **Rename Generation**: File Rename Service creates naming suggestions
6. **Notification**: Users notified of processing completion

### Search & Discovery Flow
1. **Search Request**: User submits search query via API
2. **Cache Check**: Redis cache checked for recent results
3. **Database Query**: PostgreSQL queried for matching content
4. **Web Scraping**: External sources scraped if needed (with rate limiting)
5. **Result Assembly**: Results combined and ranked
6. **Response & Caching**: Results returned and cached for future requests
