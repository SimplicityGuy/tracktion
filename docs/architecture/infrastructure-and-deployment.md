# Infrastructure and Deployment

This section defines the deployment architecture and practices for the **tracktion** project. It outlines how the Dockerized services will be built, deployed, and managed across different environments.

### **Infrastructure as Code**

  * **Tool:** Docker Compose
  * **Location:** `infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml`
  * **Approach:** Docker Compose will be used for local development and simplified single-host deployments. As the project scales, this can be migrated to a more robust IaC solution like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.

### **Deployment Strategy**

  * **Strategy:** The project will use a push-to-deploy strategy from a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Each service, being independently containerized, can be updated without affecting others.
  * **CI/CD Platform:** **GitHub Actions** will be used as the CI/CD platform.
  * **Pipeline Configuration:** The pipeline configuration will be located in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### **Environments**

  * **Development:** Used for local development and testing. Runs all services via `docker-compose`.
  * **Staging:** A pre-production environment to test the full system integration before deploying to production.
  * **Production:** The live environment serving the application.

### **Environment Promotion Flow**

```text
(Code Commit) --> (CI Pipeline: Test) --> (Build Docker Images) --> (Push to Registry) --> (Manual Gate: Deploy to Staging) --> (Test in Staging) --> (Manual Gate: Deploy to Production)
```

### **Rollback Strategy**

  * **Primary Method:** Rollback will be handled by redeploying the previous, known-good Docker image version.
  * **Trigger Conditions:** Rollback will be triggered by a critical failure in production, such as an unrecoverable service crash or a major data integrity issue.
