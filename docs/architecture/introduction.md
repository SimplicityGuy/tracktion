# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **tracktion**, focusing on the backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns that will form the project's foundation. [cite\_start]Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies[cite: 2604, 2605].

[cite\_start]The architecture is designed to support the core goals identified in the PRD[cite: 2604]:

  * Automatically cataloging a large music collection.
  * Analyzing recordings for metadata (BPM, key, mood).
  * Integrating with external data sources like `1001tracklists.com`.
  * Creating a scalable and extensible system for future development, such as a frontend application or new analysis features.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**

Based on the information provided in the Project Brief, this appears to be a new (greenfield) project, although you mentioned having some portions of it prototyped. I will assume we are starting the architecture from scratch, with the intent of incorporating your prototyped code as we move forward. To ensure this is correct, please provide any details on existing code or starter templates you are using. If none are provided, I will proceed with the design from scratch, noting this assumption.
