# Error Handling Strategy

This section defines a comprehensive and consistent approach to error handling across all microservices, with an added focus on datastore resilience and data integrity. The strategy ensures clarity, observability, and the ability to gracefully handle connection loss.

### **General Approach**

  * **Error Model:** Errors will be handled by a centralized error-handling middleware or decorator in each service. This will ensure that all exceptions are caught and processed consistently.
  * **Error Propagation:** Errors will be logged with a unique correlation ID before being propagated. This ID will be passed through all messages in the RabbitMQ queue, allowing for end-to-end tracing of a single workflow.

### **Logging Standards**

  * **Library:** We will use a standard Python logging library, configured to output structured logs (e.g., JSON format).
  * **Levels:** We will use standard logging levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`.
  * **Required Context:** Every log message must include a timestamp, the service name, the log level, and the unique correlation ID.

### **Error Handling Patterns**

  * **External API Errors:**
      * **Retry Policy:** The `Tracklist Service` will implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors when querying `1001tracklists.com`.
      * **Timeout Configuration:** A clear timeout will be configured for all external API calls to prevent services from hanging indefinitely.
  * **Business Logic Errors:**
      * **Custom Exceptions:** We will define a clear hierarchy of custom exceptions to represent specific business logic failures (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `InvalidTracklistDataError`).
  * **Datastore Resilience:**
      * **Connection Management:** All datastore-interacting code will be designed with a connection retry mechanism. If a connection is lost, the service will attempt to re-establish it with a backoff policy to prevent overwhelming the database.
  * **Data Consistency:**
      * **Transaction Strategy:** The `Cataloging Service` will use database transactions to ensure that either the `Recording` entry is created successfully or no changes are committed to the database. For critical transactions, an idempotent approach will be used to ensure that a failed operation can be safely retried upon re-connection without creating duplicate data. Upon reconnection, the system will verify the state of the data to avoid loss.
