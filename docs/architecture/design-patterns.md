# Design Patterns Used in Tracktion Services

## Overview

This document outlines the key design patterns implemented across the Tracktion microservices architecture. These patterns provide consistency, maintainability, and scalability across all services.

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Service Layer Pattern
**Used in:** All services (analysis_service, tracklist_service, file_watcher, etc.)

**Implementation:**
- Clean separation between API endpoints, business logic, and data access
- Service classes encapsulate business logic and domain operations
- Controllers/endpoints handle HTTP concerns only

**Examples:**
- `MatchingService` in tracklist_service - encapsulates matching algorithms
- `BPMDetector`/`KeyDetector` in analysis_service - domain-specific analysis logic
- Services are stateless and dependency-injected

### 2. Repository Pattern
**Used in:** All services with data persistence

**Implementation:**
- Abstract data access behind repository interfaces
- Concrete implementations handle specific storage technologies
- Enables easy testing with mock repositories

**Examples:**
- Redis caching in tracklist_service
- Neo4j graph storage in analysis_service
- File system operations in file_watcher

### 3. Strategy Pattern
**Used in:** Analysis algorithms, parsing strategies

**Implementation:**
- Multiple algorithms for the same operation (BMP detection, key detection)
- Algorithm selection based on confidence scores and agreement
- Fallback strategies when primary algorithms fail

**Examples:**
- BPM detection: RhythmExtractor2013 + PercivalBpmEstimator fallback
- Key detection: KeyExtractor + HPCP validation
- Adaptive parsing in tracklist_service with multiple extraction strategies

### 4. Observer Pattern / Event-Driven Architecture
**Used in:** Inter-service communication and file watching

**Implementation:**
- Services publish events to message queues
- Loose coupling between services through asynchronous messaging
- File system events trigger processing workflows

**Examples:**
- File changes detected by file_watcher → published to RabbitMQ
- Analysis completion → notifications to other services
- Watchdog pattern for file system monitoring

## Algorithmic Patterns

### 5. Template Method Pattern
**Used in:** Audio analysis workflows

**Implementation:**
- Define algorithm skeleton in base class
- Subclasses implement specific steps
- Consistent error handling and logging across algorithms

**Examples:**
- Audio analysis pipeline: load → analyze → validate → store
- Metadata extraction with format-specific implementations

### 6. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
**Used in:** Error handling and fallback processing

**Implementation:**
- Multiple error handlers with specific responsibilities
- Fallback chains when primary operations fail
- Graceful degradation through handler chains

**Examples:**
- Audio analysis error handling: primary → fallback → default
- HPCP key detection with multiple fallback strategies
- File format support with codec fallbacks

### 7. Factory Pattern
**Used in:** Object creation and algorithm selection

**Implementation:**
- Factory methods create appropriate algorithm instances
- Configuration-driven object creation
- Dependency injection containers

**Examples:**
- Audio analyzer factory based on file type
- Parser factory for different tracklist sources
- Detector factory with confidence thresholds

## Concurrency Patterns

### 8. Producer-Consumer Pattern
**Used in:** Message queue processing and file scanning

**Implementation:**
- Producers generate work items (file events, analysis requests)
- Consumers process work items asynchronously
- Queue-based decoupling of production and consumption rates

**Examples:**
- File system events → analysis requests
- Batch processing of audio files
- Message queue workers

### 9. Thread Pool Pattern
**Used in:** Concurrent processing within services

**Implementation:**
- Fixed-size thread pools for CPU-bound operations
- Async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Resource management and backpressure handling

**Examples:**
- `AsyncAudioProcessor` with configurable thread pools
- Concurrent file scanning in batches
- Parallel analysis of audio tracks

### 10. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Used in:** External service integration and resilience

**Implementation:**
- Automatic failure detection and recovery
- Service degradation when external dependencies fail
- Health checks and automatic restoration

**Examples:**
- Analysis service integration from tracklist_service
- Cache fallback when Redis is unavailable
- Database connection management

## Caching Patterns

### 11. Cache-Aside Pattern
**Used in:** Redis caching in tracklist_service

**Implementation:**
- Application manages cache population
- Cache misses trigger data fetching and cache updating
- TTL-based expiration with different policies

**Examples:**
- Search result caching with failure tracking
- Metadata caching with version-aware invalidation

### 12. Write-Through Caching
**Used in:** Metadata and analysis result storage

**Implementation:**
- Writes go to both cache and persistent storage
- Ensures cache consistency with storage
- Performance optimization for read-heavy workloads

## Error Handling Patterns

### 13. Retry Pattern with Exponential Backoff
**Used in:** Network operations and external service calls

**Implementation:**
- Configurable retry attempts with increasing delays
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Circuit breaking when retry limits exceeded

**Examples:**
- Web scraping with rate limiting
- Database connection retries
- Message queue connection recovery

### 14. Bulkhead Pattern
**Used in:** Resource isolation and failure containment

**Implementation:**
- Separate thread pools for different operation types
- Resource quotas to prevent resource exhaustion
- Failure isolation between different workflows

**Examples:**
- Separate pools for file I/O vs. CPU-intensive analysis
- Memory limits for different analysis types
- Connection pool isolation

## Configuration Patterns

### 15. Configuration Object Pattern
**Used in:** All services for settings management

**Implementation:**
- Centralized configuration classes with validation
- Environment variable integration with defaults
- Type-safe configuration with dataclasses

**Examples:**
- Service-specific config classes with validation
- Hierarchical configuration with overrides
- Feature flag support

### 16. Dependency Injection Pattern
**Used in:** Service composition and testability

**Implementation:**
- Constructor injection of dependencies
- Interface-based dependencies for testing
- Configuration-driven dependency resolution

**Examples:**
- Service classes injected with configured dependencies
- Mock services for testing
- Environment-specific implementations

## Monitoring and Observability Patterns

### 17. Structured Logging Pattern
**Used in:** All services for consistent logging

**Implementation:**
- Structured JSON logging with consistent fields
- Contextual information in log entries
- Log aggregation and analysis support

**Examples:**
- Request tracing with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics in log entries
- Error context preservation

### 18. Health Check Pattern
**Used in:** Service monitoring and deployment

**Implementation:**
- Health endpoints for service status
- Dependency health checking
- Graceful degradation indicators

**Examples:**
- Database connectivity checks
- External service availability
- Resource utilization monitoring

## Benefits of These Patterns

1. **Consistency:** Uniform approaches across all services
2. **Maintainability:** Well-known patterns make code easier to understand
3. **Testability:** Patterns support dependency injection and mocking
4. **Scalability:** Async patterns and resource management
5. **Resilience:** Error handling and fallback patterns
6. **Performance:** Caching and concurrency patterns

## Pattern Evolution

As the system grows, consider these additional patterns:
- **Saga Pattern** for distributed transactions
- **CQRS** for read/write separation
- **Event Sourcing** for audit trails
- **Strangler Fig** for legacy system migration
