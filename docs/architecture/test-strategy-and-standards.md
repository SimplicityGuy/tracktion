# Test Strategy and Standards

This section defines the comprehensive test strategy for the **tracktion** project, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability and quality of our services. The goal is to establish a testing philosophy that aligns with our microservices architecture and Python-based stack.

### **Testing Philosophy**

  * **Approach:** We will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach where possible, writing tests for a small piece of functionality before implementing the code.
  * **Coverage Goals:** We will aim for high code coverage, with a minimum of 80% coverage for new code.
  * **Test Pyramid:** We will adhere to the test pyramid model, with a broad base of fast, numerous unit tests, a smaller number of integration tests, and a few high-level end-to-end (E2E) tests.
  * **Quality Gates:** All tests MUST pass before any story or task can be considered complete.

### **Test Types and Organization**

  * **Unit Tests:**
      * **Framework:** `pytest` will be used as the primary unit testing framework.
      * **Execution:** All test commands must use `uv run pytest` instead of `pytest` directly.
      * **File Convention:** Test files will be named `test_*.py` and located in the `tests/unit/` directory.
      * **AI Agent Requirements:** Developers should generate tests for all public methods and cover edge cases and error conditions.
      * **Task Completion:** Unit tests MUST be run and pass after each task implementation:
        - Run specific test file: `uv run pytest tests/unit/path/to/test_file.py -v`
        - Run all unit tests: `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v`
  * **Integration Tests:**
      * **Scope:** These tests will validate the interactions between our services and external dependencies, such as PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and RabbitMQ.
      * **Location:** Integration tests will be placed in the `tests/integration/` directory.
      * **Test Infrastructure:** Dockerized environments will be used to run real instances of our datastores and message queues for accurate testing.
  * **End-to-End Tests:**
      * **Scope:** These will be a small number of tests that validate the entire end-to-end workflow, such as a file being added and successfully cataloged in the database.
      * **Framework:** `pytest` could be extended for this, or a dedicated E2E framework could be introduced later if a frontend is added.

### **Task and Story Completion Criteria**

  * **Task Completion Requirements:**
    1. Implementation complete according to task description
    2. Unit tests written and passing
    3. Pre-commit hooks passing (`uv run pre-commit run --all-files`)
    4. Code committed with descriptive commit message

  * **Story Completion Requirements:**
    1. All tasks in the story marked as complete
    2. All unit tests passing (`uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v`)
    3. All integration tests passing when services available (`uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v`)
    4. All pre-commit hooks passing
    5. Code coverage meets minimum threshold (80% for new code)
    6. Story documentation updated if needed
    7. All code committed and pushed

### **Pre-Commit and Testing Workflow**

  * **Development Workflow:**
    1. Make code changes
    2. Run relevant unit tests: `uv run pytest tests/unit/<relevant_path> -v`
    3. Run pre-commit: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
    4. Fix any issues identified
    5. Repeat steps 2-4 until clean
    6. Commit changes
    7. Run full test suite before marking story complete

  * **Pre-Commit Checks:** The following checks MUST pass:
    - `ruff` linting and error checking
    - `ruff-format` code formatting
    - `mypy` static type checking
    - File hygiene (trailing whitespace, EOF, etc.)
    - YAML/JSON/TOML validation

### **Continuous Testing**

  * **CI Integration:** All tests will be run automatically as part of the GitHub Actions CI pipeline on every push and pull request. This ensures that no new code is merged without passing all tests.
  * **Code Coverage:** The CI pipeline will be configured to capture and report code coverage metrics for each service. This provides a measurable way to track test completeness over time.
  * **Quality Enforcement:** The CI pipeline will fail if:
    - Any unit test fails
    - Any integration test fails (when applicable)
    - Code coverage drops below threshold
    - Pre-commit hooks fail
