# Test Strategy and Standards

This section defines the comprehensive test strategy for the **tracktion** project, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability and quality of our services. The goal is to establish a testing philosophy that aligns with our microservices architecture and Python-based stack.

### **Testing Philosophy**

  * **Approach:** We will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach where possible, writing tests for a small piece of functionality before implementing the code.
  * **Coverage Goals:** We will aim for high code coverage, with specific targets to be defined for each service.
  * **Test Pyramid:** We will adhere to the test pyramid model, with a broad base of fast, numerous unit tests, a smaller number of integration tests, and a few high-level end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### **Test Types and Organization**

  * **Unit Tests:**
      * **Framework:** `pytest` will be used as the primary unit testing framework.
      * **Execution:** All test commands must use `uv run pytest` instead of `pytest` directly.
      * **File Convention:** Test files will be named `test_*.py` and located in the `tests/unit/` directory.
      * **AI Agent Requirements:** Developers should generate tests for all public methods and cover edge cases and error conditions.
  * **Integration Tests:**
      * **Scope:** These tests will validate the interactions between our services and external dependencies, such as PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and RabbitMQ.
      * **Location:** Integration tests will be placed in the `tests/integration/` directory.
      * **Test Infrastructure:** Dockerized environments will be used to run real instances of our datastores and message queues for accurate testing.
  * **End-to-End Tests:**
      * **Scope:** These will be a small number of tests that validate the entire end-to-end workflow, such as a file being added and successfully cataloged in the database.
      * **Framework:** `pytest` could be extended for this, or a dedicated E2E framework could be introduced later if a frontend is added.

### **Continuous Testing**

  * **CI Integration:** All tests will be run automatically as part of the GitHub Actions CI pipeline on every push and pull request. This ensures that no new code is merged without passing all tests.
  * **Code Coverage:** The CI pipeline will be configured to capture and report code coverage metrics for each service. This provides a measurable way to track test completeness over time.
