from tracktion.analysis import BPMDetector, KeyDetector, MoodAnalyzer
from pathlib import Path

async def analyze_track(file_path: str):
    print(f"🎵 Analyzing: {Path(file_path).name}")

    # Initialize analyzers
    bpm_detector = BPMDetector(confidence_threshold=0.8)
    key_detector = KeyDetector(algorithm='hpcp')
    mood_analyzer = MoodAnalyzer()

    # Run analysis
    bmp_result, key_result, mood_result = await asyncio.gather(
        bpm_detector.analyze(file_path),
        key_detector.analyze(file_path),
        mood_analyzer.analyze(file_path)
    )

    # Display results
    print(f"🥁 BPM: {bpm_result.bpm:.1f} (confidence: {bmp_result.confidence:.2f})")
    print(f"🎹 Key: {key_result.key} (confidence: {key_result.confidence:.2f})")
    print(f"😊 Mood: {', '.join(mood_result.moods[:3])}")
    print(f"⚡ Energy Level: {mood_result.energy:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = input("Enter path to audio file: ")
    asyncio.run(analyze_track(file_path))
EOF
```

**Narrator:** "I've created a simple Python script that analyzes an audio file for BPM, musical key, and mood. Let's run it!"

**[TYPE in terminal]**
```bash
uv run python analyze_track.py
```

**[SCREEN: Input prompt for file path]**

**Narrator:** "The script is asking for the path to an audio file. I'll enter the path to our sample track."

**[TYPE file path]**
```
/path/to/sample/electronic_dance_track.mp3
```

**[SCREEN: Analysis running with progress]**

**Narrator:** "Tracktion is now analyzing the audio file. It's extracting audio features, detecting the tempo, analyzing the harmonic content for key detection, and processing the spectral features for mood analysis."

**[SCREEN: Results displayed]**
```
🎵 Analyzing: electronic_dance_track.mp3
🥁 BPM: 128.5 (confidence: 0.94)
🎹 Key: C major (confidence: 0.87)
😊 Mood: energetic, happy, uplifting
⚡ Energy Level: 0.82
```

#### Understanding Results (6:00 - 7:30)
**[SCREEN: Results highlighted with explanations]**

**Narrator:** "Excellent! Let's break down these results:

**BPM: 128.5** - This is the tempo in beats per minute. 128 BPM is typical for dance/electronic music. The confidence of 0.94 means Tracktion is very certain about this measurement.

**Key: C major** - This is the musical key. C major is a common key with no sharps or flats. The 0.87 confidence is quite good for key detection.

**Mood: energetic, happy, uplifting** - These are the top mood descriptors. Perfect for a dance track!

**Energy Level: 0.82** - This ranges from 0 to 1, with 0.82 being quite high-energy."

**[SCREEN: Show confidence score explanation graphic]**

**Narrator:** "The confidence scores tell you how reliable each measurement is. Generally:
- Above 0.8: Very reliable
- 0.6-0.8: Good reliability
- Below 0.6: Use with caution"

#### Next Steps (7:30 - 8:00)

## Tutorial 2: Understanding Audio Analysis

**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Prerequisites:** Tutorial 1 completed

### Script

#### Opening (0:00 - 0:45)
**[SCREEN: Tracktion logo with "Audio Analysis Deep Dive" title]**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back to the Tracktion tutorial series! In our last video, we got Tracktion running and analyzed our first audio file. Today, we're going to understand what all those numbers and labels actually mean, and how you can use them to make decisions about your music."

**[SCREEN: Agenda slide]**
"We'll cover:
- What BPM detection really means
- Understanding musical keys and why they matter
- Mood and energy analysis explained
- Confidence scores and when to trust them
- Practical applications for each measurement"

#### BPM Analysis Deep Dive (0:45 - 3:30)
**[SCREEN: Waveform visualization of audio track]**

**Narrator:** "Let's start with BPM - beats per minute. This might seem straightforward, but there's more to it than you might think."

**[SCREEN: Show tempo detection algorithm visualization]**

**Narrator:** "Tracktion uses multiple algorithms to detect tempo. It looks for patterns in the audio that repeat regularly - like drum hits, basslines, or other rhythmic elements."

**[TYPE in terminal - show multiple BPM detection methods]**
```python
from tracktion.analysis import BPMDetector

# Different algorithms for different music types
detector_electronic = BPMDetector(algorithm='onset_detection')
detector_acoustic = BPMDetector(algorithm='beat_tracking')
detector_multiband = BPMDetector(algorithm='multiband')
```

**[SCREEN: Show BPM analysis of different music genres]**

**Narrator:** "Here's the same track analyzed with different algorithms. Notice how they might give slightly different results:"

```
Electronic Algorithm: 128.5 BPM (confidence: 0.94)
Acoustic Algorithm: 128.2 BPM (confidence: 0.89)
Multiband Algorithm: 128.7 BPM (confidence: 0.92)
```

**[SCREEN: Visual representation of tempo categories]**

**Narrator:** "BPM ranges typically correspond to different music styles:
- 60-90 BPM: Ballads, lo-fi, chill
- 90-110 BPM: Hip-hop, funk, some pop
- 110-130 BPM: House, disco, most pop
- 130-150 BPM: Techno, trance, harder dance
- 150+ BPM: Drum and bass, hardcore, metal"

#### Musical Key Detection (3:30 - 6:00)
**[SCREEN: Piano keyboard showing C major scale]**

**Narrator:** "Now let's talk about key detection. This is where things get really interesting for musicians and DJs."

**[SCREEN: Chromagram visualization]**

**Narrator:** "Tracktion analyzes the chromagram - essentially a 12-dimensional representation of how much each musical note is present in the audio over time."

**[SCREEN: Show HPCP algorithm diagram]**

**Narrator:** "The HPCP algorithm - Harmonic Pitch Class Profile - is what Tracktion uses by default. It's particularly good at handling complex harmonic content."

**[TYPE in terminal]**
```python
# Analyze key with detailed output
key_result = await key_detector.analyze("sample.mp3", detailed=True)
print(f"Key: {key_result.key}")
print(f"Mode: {key_result.mode}")  # Major or minor
print(f"Key strength: {key_result.strength}")
print(f"Alternative keys: {key_result.alternatives}")
```

**[SCREEN: Show harmonic mixing wheel (Camelot wheel)]**

**Narrator:** "For DJs, key information is crucial for harmonic mixing. Keys that are adjacent on the Camelot wheel mix well together:"

```
Compatible with C major (8B):
- G major (9B) - Perfect fifth
- F major (7B) - Perfect fourth
- A minor (8A) - Relative minor
```

**[SCREEN: Show two tracks being mixed with compatible keys]**

**Narrator:** "When you mix tracks in compatible keys, the result sounds harmonious rather than clashing. This is why DJ software often shows key information prominently."

#### Mood and Energy Analysis (6:00 - 8:30)
**[SCREEN: Spectral analysis visualization]**

**Narrator:** "Mood and energy analysis is where machine learning really shines. Tracktion analyzes multiple audio features simultaneously:"

**[SCREEN: Feature extraction diagram]**
```
Audio Features Used:
- Spectral centroid (brightness)
- Zero-crossing rate (noisiness)
- Spectral rolloff (frequency distribution)
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (timbre)
- Tempo and rhythm patterns
- Harmonic vs. percussive content
```

**[SCREEN: Mood classification results for different tracks]**

**Narrator:** "Let's see how different tracks score on various mood dimensions:"

```python
# Compare mood analysis across genres
jazz_track = await mood_analyzer.analyze("smooth_jazz.mp3")
metal_track = await mood_analyzer.analyze("heavy_metal.mp3")
ambient_track = await mood_analyzer.analyze("ambient_pad.mp3")

print("Jazz:", jazz_track.moods)     # ['relaxed', 'sophisticated', 'smooth']
print("Metal:", metal_track.moods)   # ['aggressive', 'energetic', 'intense']
print("Ambient:", ambient_track.moods) # ['calm', 'atmospheric', 'peaceful']
```

**[SCREEN: Energy level meter visualization]**

**Narrator:** "Energy levels range from 0 to 1:
- 0.0-0.3: Very low energy, ambient, meditative
- 0.3-0.5: Low-moderate energy, chill, relaxed
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate energy, most pop music
- 0.7-0.9: High energy, dance, rock
- 0.9-1.0: Very high energy, aggressive styles"

#### Confidence Scores and Reliability (8:30 - 9:30)
**[SCREEN: Confidence score visualization]**

**Narrator:** "Understanding confidence scores is crucial for making good decisions with your analysis results."

**[SCREEN: Graph showing confidence vs. accuracy correlation]**

**Narrator:** "Tracktion's confidence scores are calibrated - a confidence of 0.8 means the result is correct about 80% of the time in testing."

**[TYPE in terminal - show confidence-based filtering]**
```python
# Filter results by confidence
def get_reliable_results(analysis_result, min_confidence=0.7):
    results = {}

    if analysis_result.bmp_confidence >= min_confidence:
        results['bpm'] = analysis_result.bpm

    if analysis_result.key_confidence >= min_confidence:
        results['key'] = analysis_result.key

    return results
```

**[SCREEN: Example of low-confidence detection]**

**Narrator:** "Here's an example where you might want to be cautious - a classical piece with no steady beat gives us a BPM of 72 but only 0.43 confidence. This tells us the algorithm struggled with this track."

#### Practical Applications (9:30 - 10:00)
**[SCREEN: Use case examples]**

**Narrator:** "Now you understand what these measurements mean, here's how you can use them:

**For DJs:** Use BPM and key for beatmatching and harmonic mixing
**For Fitness:** Filter by energy level and BPM range for workout playlists
**For Mood Playlists:** Combine mood tags with energy levels
**For Music Discovery:** Find similar tracks using multiple features together"

**[SCREEN: Next tutorial preview]**

**Narrator:** "In our next tutorial, we'll put this knowledge to work by creating intelligent playlists that use all these features together. Subscribe so you don't miss it, and I'll see you in the next video!"
