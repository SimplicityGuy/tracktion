# Thread Safety Improvements for Feedback Learning System

## Summary

Fixed thread safety issues in the feedback learning system by adding proper locking mechanisms to protect shared mutable state from concurrent access.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/services/file_rename_service/app/feedback/learning.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `import asyncio` for async locking support
- Added `self._state_lock = asyncio.Lock()` in `__init__()` to protect shared mutable state
- Protected `_update_count` increment with async lock context manager
- Protected `_model_version` update with async lock context manager
- Used thread-safe access patterns when reading shared state for logging and returns

**Protected Shared State:**
- `_update_count` - Counter for model updates
- `_model_version` - Current model version string

### 2. `/services/file_rename_service/app/feedback/processor.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `self._counter_lock = asyncio.Lock()` for protecting counter operations
- Added `self._list_lock = asyncio.Lock()` for protecting the pending feedback list
- Modified `submit_feedback()` to use separate locks for list and processing operations
- Updated `_should_process_batch()` to use thread-safe list access
- Refactored `_process_batch()` to use thread-safe operations:
  - Safe copying of pending feedback under lock
  - Safe counter updates under lock
  - Safe list clearing using slicing to handle race conditions
- Updated `_trigger_retrain()` to safely access counters
- Modified `force_batch_processing()` to safely check for pending items

**Protected Shared State:**
- `_pending_feedback` - List of pending feedback items
- `_total_processed` - Counter for total processed items
- `_last_batch_time` - Timestamp of last batch processing

## Thread Safety Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Separate Locks for Different Concerns**
- `_list_lock` - Protects the pending feedback list
- `_counter_lock` - Protects counters and metrics
- `_processing_lock` - Protects batch processing workflow
- `_state_lock` - Protects model state in learner

### 2. **Lock Ordering to Prevent Deadlocks**
- Consistent lock acquisition order: list locks before processing locks
- Minimal lock scope - acquire just before use, release immediately after

### 3. **Safe List Operations**
- Copy-on-read pattern for processing batches
- Slice-based clearing to handle concurrent modifications
- Boolean checks under lock to avoid TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) issues

### 4. **Atomic Operations**
- Counter updates under dedicated locks
- State reads captured to local variables while locked
- Immutable data passed between operations

## Testing and Validation

✅ **Pre-commit Checks**: All ruff, mypy, and other quality checks pass
✅ **Unit Tests**: 21/22 existing tests pass (1 unrelated mock failure)
✅ **Concurrent Operations**: Successfully tested with 5 concurrent feedback submissions
✅ **Lock Verification**: All expected locks are properly initialized

## Benefits

1. **Thread Safety**: Eliminates race conditions in concurrent environments
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents corruption of counters and shared state
3. **Consistency**: Ensures batch processing operations are atomic
4. **Scalability**: Supports multiple concurrent feedback submissions
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated locks

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: asyncio.Lock has very low overhead for async operations
- **Granular Locking**: Separate locks minimize contention
- **Short Lock Duration**: Locks held only for critical sections
- **No Blocking**: All operations remain fully asynchronous

## Future Considerations

- Consider using `asyncio.Semaphore` if we need to limit concurrent operations
- Monitor for potential deadlocks if adding new locks in the future
- Consider upgrading to more sophisticated patterns like read-write locks if needed for high-read scenarios
